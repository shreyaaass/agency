I don't want you show it to us right now I don't want to show anybody my birth certificate it's embarrassing what's embarrassing about it my weight on it it says that was born seven pounds 800 ounces you know what I would do if I were president mr. president I would make same-sex divorce illegal didn't see how bad they want it I think that's why you're not president and that's a good thing you said if you had a son you would not let him play football what makes you think that he would want to play football what if he was a nerd like you do you think a woman like Michelle would marry a nerd I why don't you ask her whether she thinks I'm a nerd good night no I'm not gonna let her near you so do you go to any websites that are coms or.net soar do you mainly just stick with dot Govs no actually we go to dot Govs have you heard of healthcare.gov here we go okay let's get this out of the way what did you come here to plug well first of all I think it's fair to say that I wouldn't be with you here today if I didn't have something to plug have you heard of the Affordable Care Act oh yeah I heard about that that's the thing that doesn't work why would you get the guy that created the Zune to make your website healthcare.gov work so great now and millions of Americans have already gotten health insurance plans and what we want is for people to know that you can get affordable health care most young Americans right now they're not covered and the truth is is that they can get coverage all for what it costs you to pay your cell phone bill this is what they mean by drones the point is that a lot of young people they think they're invincible did you say in invisible because no no that's impossible not not invisible invincible meaning but they don't think they can get hurt I'm just saying that nobody could be invisible if you had said invisible I understand that if they get that health insurance it can really make a big difference and they've got till March 31st to sign up I don't have a computer so how does well then you can call 1-800 three one eight two five nine six I don't have a phone I'm off the grid it I don't want you people like looking at my text if you don't I mean first of all Zac nobody's interested in your taxes but second of all you can do it in person and the law means that insurers can't discriminate against you if you've got a pre-existing condition anymore yeah but what about what about this though that's disgusting how how long have you have it I'll just four months really spider bites I got attacked by spiders Zac you you need to get that checked right away you need to get on healthcare.gov because that that's one most disgusting things I've ever seen is your plug finally over I suppose so so which country were you rooting for in the Winter Olympics seriously I'm the president United States what do you think that I want to thank President Obama for being on the show I'm gonna press this I don't touch that please Shh thanks for the interview and thanks for letting me shoot my show here all these years you've been shooting these these shows here in the diplomatic room who gave you permission to do that Bush seriously who gave him clearance what's the spider bite that's the other hand it's everywhere [Music] [Applause]

The Small Escape.,"1964. Berlin is a divided city. Flight from the German Democratic Republic is punished with an order to fire. Still, many people desperately try to cross the border. For all backgrounds to the true history of the spectacular escape, read the article here: https://b.mw/isetta_escape_story  People forge identity papers, dig tunnels, climb into hot-air balloons and hide in cars going to the West - towards freedom. But as large vehicles are getting controlled more frequently and thoroughly, a West Berliner has a seemingly impossible but ingenious idea: the smallest and most inconspicuous car available at the time, the BMW Isetta, should help him smuggle a man across the border into the West.    ► For more upcoming videos subscribe to the BMW YouTube Channel: http://b.mw/youtube-subscribe   ► Explore More Videos: The all-new BMW 3 Series Touring.  https://youtu.be/SbgqqR67_gI The all-new BMW 1 Series.

Save Ralph - A short film with Taika Waititi,"Introducing Ralph, the spokes-bunny of Humane Society International’s global campaign to ban animal testing for cosmetics. #SaveRalph is a powerful stop-motion animation short film featuring an all-star multinational cast including Taika Waititi, Ricky Gervais, Zac Efron, Olivia Munn, Pom Klementieff, Tricia Helfer and more. https://www.hsi.org/saveralphmovie/  SAVE RALPH is a powerful stop-motion animation short film featuring Oscar winner Taika Waititi as the voice of Ralph, who is being interviewed for a documentary as he goes through his daily routine as a “tester” in a lab. HSI’s #SaveRalph campaign tackles the cruelty of animal testing in an original and unexpected way—using the story of one bunny to shine a light on the plight of countless rabbits and other animals in laboratories around the world.   While Ralph is animated, the miseries he endures in the short film are far from made up. As Spencer Susser, the director of Save Ralph, says, “It's so important that Ralph feels real because he represents countless real animals who suffer every day.”   Susser, known for his film Hesher, is among a slate of powerhouse celebrities and influencers who collaborated with Humane Society International on the making of Save Ralph. In addition to Waititi as Ralph and Gervais as the interviewer, the film has Zac Efron as Bobby, Olivia Munn as Marshmallow, Pom Klementieff as Cinnamon and Tricia Helfer as Cottonballs.   Producer Jeff Vespa (Voices of Parkland) teamed up with the Arch Model studio of puppet maker supreme Andy Gent (Isle of Dogs, The Grand Budapest Hotel) and Executive Producers Donna Gadomski, Troy Seidle and Peter Kline on the production.   Since its April 2021 premiere, Save Ralph has raised global awareness of the cruelty of cosmetic animal testing and motivated millions of people around the world to sign HSI’s petition to ban this unnecessary practice. As a result, the film helped propel Mexico, Brazil and Canada to ban cosmetic animal testing and is helping advance legislation in several countries that make up the world’s most influential beauty markets.  As a result, the film helped propel Mexico, Brazil, Canada and Chile to ban cosmetic animal testing and is helping advance legislation in several countries that make up the world’s most influential beauty markets.  https://hsi.org/saveralph",16168608,ready we're rolling okay ralph can you mark it please do you want me to click it now yep go for it go on like that brilliant oh it's like in the movies alrighty so um my name's ralph um i'm a rabbit as you can see i'm blind in my right eye and uh this year can't hear nothing but ringing now yeah it's annoying isn't it yeah so i had my fur shaved and got chemical burns up and down my back kind of stings i but it's not a big deal i mean it only really hurts when i like breathe or move around or whatever ah yeah oh yeah that hurts but at the end of the day i mean it's okay we do it for the humans right they're far superior to us animals they've even been to space have you ever seen a rabbit in a rocket ship i don't think so [Music] point is i'm not a space bunny i'm a tester my daddy was a tester my mum my brothers my sisters my kids all testers and they all died doing their job like i will that's okay this thing is what we were born to do it makes us rabbits happy oh gotta get to work now i know it looks bad but the way i see it i'm doing my job if just one human can have the illusion of a safer lipstick or deodorant or hey ralphie ralphie what's with the camera crew bro oh um they're just following me around making a documentary or something oh can you ask him to get us out of here yeah yeah we'll be seeing come on ralphie just ask me i don't want uh you can edit that out right oh here we go uh so uh certain closing i'd um i'd just like to say that sorry ralph uh we're over here could you turn around oh sorry that's all right um is this better yeah yeah carry on mate okay so yeah i'd just like to say to everyone out there still buying animal tested cosmetics like eyeliner shampoo sunscreen pretty much everything in your bathroom well without you and countries that allow animal testing i'd be out of a job i'd be on the streets well not the streets more like a field i guess you know like a normal rabbit but hey so good you
Walk on water (Liquid Mountaineering),"http://www.hi-tec.com/infinity-run/    Liquid Mountaineering is a new sport which is attempting to achieve what man has tried to do for centuries: walk on water. Or to be more precise: running on water. We are developing the sport from scratch. By accident we found out that with the right water repellent equipment you can run across bodies of water, just like a stone skimming the surface.     Liquid mountaineering is performed by professionals under professional supervision. Accordingly I must insist that attempting to do so is dangerous.    We like to thank the people at Hi-Tec for their support.  http://www.hi-tec.com/liquid-mountaineering/",15486601,few people have tried it nobody has ever managed to get anywhere close to what we got like today you have to believe you can do these things it's not like impossible there's been a few people that have been like sort of following us as me my boots and I we're gonna make it our definitely thing is gonna be the next big thing liquid mountaineering is actually a oops brain charge the new sport was not existing before you have to run very fast the water I mean obviously the first step is the most important one when we like discovered oh my god Jesus we're going one step we're going to step so go in three steps we're discovering it as we go along while we still on land we try to get up really speed Sylvie we touch the water we try to get leg like a sewing machine it's not straight into the water you know in the kerf and a slight curve and by that bend you actually not allowing yourself to sink into the water and you want to keep that skimming sensation going as long as you can what gets us those extra steps are these shoes the original equipment we're first all started was equipment that would help repel water always found some shoes by mistake actually totally water repellent Ward's like water off a duck's back it takes actually a lot of practice a lot of focus I think if you don't actually believe that you're gonna walk on that water it's not gonna happen for you working on a jetski system episode that pulls us into the water with a bit more speed be with yourself believe in it is not about miracle is just go for it try to do it if you fall down try again people want you to think in a certain way and and and this sport actually allows you to push your horizons further it's just it's not boxing you in and saying that's what you are you're just like you're moving past at all

Superpower for Hire: Rise of the Private Military,"Click here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE  Vice takes an unprecedented look into the shadowy industry of Private Military Companies.  For the past two decades these private companies, like Black Water, Aegis and G4S have silently consumed military operations around the world, doing everything from back end logistics, protection of government VIP's and diplomats to actual combat duties.  In this documentary we explore the origins of this industry, their rise in the war on terror and their future operations around the world.    00:00 Intro 03:09 The Rise of PMCs 05:07 The Man Who Started it All  06:14 What It Takes to Become a Soldier for Hire 10:58 The Morals of PMCs   Check out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos Videos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com Like VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice Follow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice Read our tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com Follow us on instagram: http://instagram.com/vice",13107184,"Rock and roll This is Tony Shiena Owner of Mosaic Security Private Military Company that provides Elite forces level security for their clients Tony has a VIP coming into Caracas tomorrow, who we'll need to guard We tagged along as he scouted out a particularly dangerous neighbourhood That we will need to pass through in the morning It's called The Triple X Barrier The main issue with this client, is, we need to pick him up at (inaudible) airport and deliver him to his meeting at the military installation but there's no circumventing this These guys should be flanking on each side Okay, he's already seen a potential shooter Considering the police claim 25 people are shot in this barrier a day The armed person they spotted was not taken lightly This is the wrong (bleep) place to be Although we were able to get out without incident it was clear that tomorrow's security was going to need to be very serious We're at an airport about to extract a client So the idea is that we have got to get him from here To go to meet a government contractor There've been a number of attempts on his life So, you know, tensions are running a little bit high Everybody recover, recover, recover So there have been two or three attempts on your life? For the business that you work in, you wouldn't be able to operate without these guys taking you through countries While providing highly trained security for VIPs like Pablo is one role PMCs play, its really just the tip of the iceberg In fact, the International Private Military Industry, has been exploding over the last 20 years To find out more about this new modern world of mercenaries We spoke to P. W. Singer, author of the book: Corporate Warriors: The  Rise of the Private Military Industry A Private Military Company, a PMC, is Private Companies, taking on roles that have traditionally been done by the military and intelligence agencies by the broader, national security complex We have this assumption of war and who fights it a man in uniform and that uniform, to us, means well they're part of a national military and when you look at the 21st Century, that image in our mind... It just doesn't hold true These companies have taken on all the different roles of war Everything from the back-end logistics, to training and consulting, to the tactical battlefield role Pretty much, its the new American way of war, whether you're talking about Iraq or now Afganistan Roughly half of the force there, is Private Military [Jedd} In fact, business is SO good, that the global market for Private Security Services is projected to reach $218 billion in 2014 and as more and more aspects of modern war and security are outsources to PMCs, these companies are poised to grow even larger [P. W. Singer] Outsourcing is always about cost savings its the number of people that you don't have to to call up from your national guard and reserves to take on these roles Deaths, Injuries, Capture of Private Military Contractors Doesn't resonate into the political world the same way it does for someone in the military so we're seeing everything from companies that have being operating in Iraq, now doing things like counter-piracy operations off Somalia, to the emergence of Chinese Private Security Companies operating in Africa, or the Russians use private contractors during their Crimea operation when we look at the future frontiers of the Private Military Industry, they reflect the next frontiers of war To find out more about this massive industry, that is fast becoming the future of war we spoke to the man that, almost, single handedly created the modern PMC as we know it We're here in Abu-Dhabi and we're going to interview one of the most important people in the PMC world, Eric Prince, who was the founder of Blackwater PMCs are as American as Thanksgiving Day [the] First Colonies were started by contractors, they were hired to secure most logistics of private companies Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth Colonies were, uh, were private endevours Now look, I started Blackwater as a way to stay connected to the SEAL teams When our customers called us, we ran very hard to fill their needs but we were mischaracterised as ""out of control mercenaries"" and the fact is we were American Veterans serving America again and getting paid on a competitively bid contact. ""Full stop"" We did exactly the job the U.S government hired us to do and did it well, more than 100 000 missions, on the security side, no one under our care ever killed or injured [Jedd] For a first hand look to see what it takes to become a ""soldier for hire"" we travelled to the Czech Republic to the ""Anti-Terror Academy"" a former military base which is now one of the most popular security training facilities in Europe This is where future PMC soldiers are going to be freshening up their skills before they go out and work In theory, even people like me can do these training courses and basically be guns for hire Make sure you focus on that foresight Okay Squeeze in the trigger Although they are willing to train beginners like me, it was clear that a vast majority of the guys there were former military, running through combat drills ""How did you get into all of this?"" ""So I left the army, because the money wasn't good enough for what I was getting paid to do. Why would I do 5 years in Iraq..."" ""in the army and earn $120 grand, when I can do 2 years in Iraq and earn $400 grand..."" ""Certainly in my era, anybody who is any good in the army, isn't in the army anymore"" [Jedd] The main goal of a facility like this is to take the elite skills these soldiers already have for offensive combat and reshape them to provide defensive, special forces level security and protection [Instructor] ""The 2 guys behind, they just push out"" (gun cocks) [Jedd] But, as I watched them run their drills, it was clear that these manoeuvres were much more than just offensive They aren't only learning to provide additional support and security They are essentially becoming their own army Nobody nows more about what it means to have Private Armies for hire than the world famous mercenary, Simon Mann after serving the British Special Forces, he spent over 20 years in the PMC industry until 2004 when he served 5 years in prison in Equatorial Guinea for his role in attempting to help stage a coup a private military company, to me, is a company that  is prepared to carry out full on offensive military operations under a contract, ""(inaudible) you pay us a load of money and we will help you win your war"" Where I get worried is when you start saying ""No the way forward is for combat operations to be privatised and given out wholesale to the private sector There are certain things that armies have to do and a way of doing them that should not be in the private sector These guys are fighting for money, they're not fighting for the state, their not fighting out of sense of duty or patriotism when it gets serious is when you get a PMC that starts to get excessively muscular the line between defence and offence gets very quickly blurred so immediately any decent soldiers will start thinking ""Instead of waiting here to be shot, why don't we go out there and bag the bad guys before they manage to shoot us?"" and suddenly, you know, the rules start to get bent [Jedd] The further you look into the training around the world for PMCs The more you realise that they're public face as simply defensive security is only one side to their capabilities So we're here to see Mick Cowan He's a former sniper and he's now a PMC He's asked us to keep his location secret because he just doesn't want people to know where this is going on. We're going to spend a little bit of time with him to kind of find out what he does how it all works. [Mick] I operate as a consultant for a number of companies and I step in and provide the actual instruction ability [Jedd] Simple put he trains PMCs to be snipers using the latest military techniques and hardware [Mick] Basically an AR-15 M4, with a red dot sight on it [Jedd] And it's not just about shooting accuracy, they also teach you how to blend in with your environment So your target doesn't even know you exist [Mick] Jedd, you gotta be really low and slow. (grunt) Is there any kind of contracts that come along that you just morally don't agree with or don't take Yes, certainly there would be jobs that I could see coming along that I would go ""Hmmmm, thanks but no thanks"" But, morality is down to the individual and down to the companies themselves You'll always get people who are morally repugnant, but you'll always get cowboys [Jedd] But its not only the moral question of who these cowboys might work for that makes many uneasy For veteran journalist Robert Pelton, who witnessed the rise of PMC in both Iraq and Afgahnistan first hand It's a concern about their willingness to blur the lines if serves their purpose It is a myth to assume that contractors are aligned with governments and they synchronise, they actually have opposing goals and there are many cases in which contractors were actually arrested by military (scoffs) in Iraq for doing exactly that, shooting at people, you know, causing a mess It's security but it doesn't seem like security because it's to keep them secure If i come up and punch you in the face and say ""That's for your protection"" that's kinda the joke You see fences going up, you see guard posts, you see people stopping you and you say ""That's not a police badge"" And it's up to the public to decide whether they think the use of force, by a non-state actor is appropriate [Jedd] In fact, the actions of some PMCs has caused such an alarm, that U.S congressman, Jan Schakowsky has introduced legislation to limit them from use in warzones altogether There has been concern about using people who don't wear the badge of the United States of America Who are not part of a chain of command Who aren't held accountable in the same ways I think what scares me the most, about these, uh, Private Military Contractors is that buy and large they operate in the shadows, the transparency isn't there, the accountability isn't there. It appears that these contractors, literally, may be able to get away with murder. [Jedd] When you consider that these companies might operate above the law, even while employed by the U.S Government The bigger question for New York Times Washington correspondent David Sanger, it what happens when PMCs Work completely outside the juristiction of America itself One big concern for Private Military Contractors is a question of allegiance When they become political instruments to help prop up a government, that's when you begin to ask the question: ""Does this corporation have the foreign policy of its own? And is that corporations foreign policy in sync or in opposition to American foreign Policy?"" Are they truly American? Or are they truly international? Who exactly are they working for? When the best and the brightest from armies around the world are now working for PMCs You have to wonder if the next military super power won't be a country but a corporation I think the PMC of the future can manipulate governments We're at a stage now where I think it can happen All CC done by Oliverpls"
Cox presents: Project Convey,"Can emojis speak louder than words?  Every day, millions of people use the Internet to connect through video chat. But for many on the autism spectrum, it’s not so easy.

1984 Apple's Macintosh Commercial (HD),"http://www.mac-history.net/apple-history-tv/ads/2011-07-12/1984-the-famous-super-bowl-spot  ""1984"" is an American television commercial which introduced the Apple Macintosh personal computer for the first time. It was conceived by Steve Hayden, Brent Thomas and Lee Clow at Chiat/Day, Venice, produced by New York production company Fairbanks Films, and directed by Ridley Scott. Anya Major performed as the unnamed heroine and David Graham as Big Brother. Its only U.S. daytime televised broadcast was on January 22, 1984 during and as part of the telecast of the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII. Chiat/Day also ran the ad one other time on television, in December 1983 right before the 1:00 am sign-off on KMVT in Twin Falls, Idaho, so that the advertisement could be submitted to award ceremonies for that year.  In addition, starting on January 17, 1984 it was screened prior to previews in movie theaters for a few weeks. It has since been seen on television commercial compilation specials, as well as in ""Retro-mercials"" on TV Land. The estate of George Orwell and the television rightsholder to the novel 1984 considered the commercial to be a flagrant copyright infringement, and sent a cease-and-desist letter to Apple and Chiat/Day in April 1984. The commercial was never televised as a commercial after that.",5028719,today we celebrate the first glorious anniversary of the information purification directives we have created for another's time in all history a garden of pure ideology we are one people with one will one resolve one cause our enemies shall talk themselves to death on january 24th apple computer will introduce macintosh and you'll see why 1984 won't be like 1984.

Tania’s Story: Morse code meets machine learning,"Ever since Morse opened developer Tania Finlayson’s world, she’s been working to make it accessible for everyone.   Interested in learning Morse code or using the keyboard Tania developed with the Gboard team? Visit https://g.co/morse",3539964,"[device beeping] Tania: Hi, I am Tania. This is my voice. I use Morse code by puttingdots and dashes with switches mounted near myhead. As a very young child, I used a communication wordboard. I used a head stick to point tothe words. It was very attractive to saythe least. Once Morse code wasincorporated into my life, it was a feeling of pureliberation and freedom. boy: See you later. Love you. Tania: I think that is why Ilike skydiving so much. It is the same kind of feeling. Through skydiving, I met Ken,the love of my life and partner in crime. Ken: It's always been very,very difficult just to find Morse codedevices, to try Morse code. Tania: This is why I had tocreate my own. With the help from Ken, I havea voice and more independence in mydaily life. But most people don't have Ken. It is our hope that we cancollaborate with the Gboard team to helppeople who want to tap into the freedom of using Morsecode. woman: Gboard is the Googlekeyboard. What we have discovered workingon Gboard is that there are entire pockets ofpopulation in the world, and when I say ""pockets,"" it's,like, tens of millions of people who have never had access to akeyboard that works in their own language. With Tania, we've built supportin Gboard for Morse code, so it's an input modality thatallows you to type in Morse code and gets textsout with predictions, suggestions. I think it's a beautifulexample of where machine learning Can really assist someone in away that a normal keyboard without artificial intelligencewouldn't be able to. Tania: I am very excited tocontinue on this journey. Many, many people will benefitfrom this, and that thrills me to no end. [gentle music]"

"Original ""got milk?"" commercial - Who shot Alexander Hamilton?","This is the one that started it all—that's right, every dumb ""got whatever?"" take-off traces its roots to this commercial.

Effective 8 November 2011, by popular demand, commenting has been disabled. It was a good run, but people just wouldn't shut up with the ""my history teacher told me to watch this commercial"" and ""lol why didn't he just spit the sandwich out?"" nonsense.

IKEA – Silence The Critics - TV Advert 90 #WonderfulEveryday,"When it comes to hosting, we all have those little voices in the back of our heads that say our home isn’t up to the job. And whether it’s the chipped mug, the crack in the wall, the weirdly shaped bathroom, or the living room that has as much personality as a cardboard box, the voices seem to zoom in on our biggest fears and magnify them until we declare our home a no-go zone. But at IKEA, we believe every home is worthy of a get together and that with a little imagination and some clever IKEA products and ideas, there’s no reason not to host.

Dead Island Trailer,"Song name & chronological version in description and response. A new trailer for zombie survival video game, Dead Island. Developed by Techland and published by Deep Silver. It is an open-ended game, centered on the challenge of survival on a zombie-infested island. The game uses a first-person perspective with RPG elements.

Cox presents Drawn Closer: An Animated Short Starring Real Middle Schoolers,"When COVID-19 cancelled their school play, Cox partnered with Thurman White Middle School and Academy Award winning director Patrick Osborne to reimagine the play as an animated short, voiced and performed by the students.  The result was Drawn Closer, a heartfelt story of a school play in trouble, and a drama class determined to save it.  Using mobile motion capture technology, the students of Thurman White middle school were able to perform together again – all from the safety of their own homes.  This film was produced by Cox and ad agency 180LA for The Connections Project – a series of initiatives directed at providing human connection where it’s needed most. We tell stories that inspire all of us to stay connected and show the power technology has to bring us closer to one another during difficult times.

Welcome to Project Jacquard,"Project Jacquard is a new system for weaving technology into fabric, transforming everyday objects, like clothes, into interactive surfaces. Project Jacquard will allow designers and developers to build connected, touch-sensitive textiles into their own products. This is just the beginning, and we're very excited to see what people will do with it. Learn more at www.projectjacquard.com.  Follow Google ATAP on Twitter for updates on Project Jacquard: https://twitter.com/GoogleATAP",1169629,"What I find fascinating about textiles, is that the structure of textiles is the same as the structure of touch screens which we use in everyday mobile devices and tablets. That means, that if you just replace some of the threads in textiles with conductive threads, you should be able to weave a textile which can recognize a variety of simple touch gestures. Just like any normal touch panel you have in a mobile phone. So if you can hide or weave interactivity and input devices into the materials, that will be the first step to making computers and computing invisibly integrated into objects, materials, and clothing. So this is exciting to me. The challenge of creating Jacquard yarn, was to create yarn that is highly conductive, and at the same time scalable. Which means it could be used in industrial weaving machines everywhere in the world. For textile designers, or fashion designers, or furniture designers, it is interesting because it is something you are very familiar with, it's just textile. We made the yarn very thin and it feels so natural, so it looks like just normal yarn. The only thing that is different, is that it is conductive. We worked with textile designers from all over the world and it's really interesting to see what kind of possibilities that we can have. It could be visible—very obviously, like it is here. It also can be totally invisible. So we are creating possibilities by combining different ways of weaving techniques. And that is totally up to the designers to choose and it is up to their creativity. We are trying to shrink down all of the components down to the size of a button. And ultimately this will be something that is so small we can embed into the manufacturing process. So the users won't even see it or feel it inside the garment. The idea that Jacquard is an interface that is blended into the clothing that we wear— that has an implication in the way that you would use services, products, applications, and anything that we do through our devices. It is somehow getting the technology out of the way and making interactions more natural and more seamless. In terms of what the technology can do, it's really up to the user and to the designers and we expect that users can reconfigure it as much as they want to. Software development and fashion design often don't exist in the same place. So we're hoping to make it very simple for each of those parties to collaborate and we're hoping to provide both software and hardware knowledge and components to make those collaborations very easy. We like to think that we have these iconic products that haven't changed much, but the world is changing so I think Jacquard presents a great opportunity for a brand, for design to open a door to the future. In tailoring we use methods that have been used and not changed for 200 years so when something new comes along, it's really exciting. What's amazing about the project is that I don't have to have any knowledge about the electronics and how it works. So let's see what we can create with it. Jacquard is a blank canvas, for designers and for developers. We are just at the beginning. And we are really excited to see what people are going to do with it."

We’re here in Montreal.  My buddies are sending me back to Australia  to get the world’s first iPhone 6 and then I’m gonna dump the bastard in a pitcher  of beer.  Shall we?  Why in Australia?  Ah, it’s because of the time-zone and the first iPhone 6 in the world will be sold in Australia, ‘cause Australia is ahead of time.  There's a good chance that we’ll get there and  fly 22 hours and not get the phone.   This could be the biggest failure in communications history.  We’re in a taxi. We’re heading to the Brisbane Apple store. And the reason why we are in Brisbane and not in Sydney is Brisbane is a smaller place and we figured Sydney would have a huge line-up.  So we’re trying our luck here. Here we go, buddy. Check that out: the Apple Store folks.  Excuse me, guys.  Hi, are you two…? You’re the first in line, are you? - Yeah.   Can I talk to you for a second? - OK  Is there any way I can get the first phone off you? - No   What if I give you ______ thousand dollars cash? - No   _____ thousand dollars cash. That’s a lot of money.  There's nothing I can do, man.  Listen, mate, I’ve got a bit of a problem. I just offered him ____ thousand dollars and he won’t take it. All right, I’m gonna do that and I’ll get back to you.  My final offer, I can give you _____ thousand dollars. - OK.   That’s a yes?  -Yeah.  Thanks you so much. Oh my god, let’s hug this out.

Did it die? – off-screen (or cameraman)  Yep, I think that’s it.  You killed it. – off-screen (or cameraman) Check.  Did you kill it?  – off-screen (or cameraman) So that’s a dead phone.  I say it’s time to revive it. When you drop your phone in water or beer or whatever  it's not the liquid that makes the thing die, it's the minerals in the liquid and somehow this stuff treats the minerals, works on the minerals, I don’t know, I’m not a scientist. Pour the liquid into the pouch and then stick the phone into there. Seal it. You leave this thing in here for seven minutes and then you take it out and dry the phone for 24 hours and you’re good to go. That's it.  All right, this guy’s been sitting outside for twenty-four hours drying and it is dry, so I guess I’ll turn it on.  Please, look at that, please look at the Apple, and please see that that works. What should I do with this phone? Let’s make a phone call.  Hang on a second. Hey, baby.  Hello. Yes it's me. Yeah, hi, look I just wanted to…  She doesn’t care.

Last Call by 13th Street the First Interactive Theatrical,"Further information on http://jedblogk.blogspot.com/2010/02/last-call-13th-street.html    The first interactive theatrical commercial by Jung von Matt & Film Deluxe.     Agency: Jung von Matt, Berlin  Production company: Film Deluxe Berlin  Director: Milo     The action: Last Call is the first interactive horror movie in the world where the audience is able to communicate with the protagonist. A film controlled by a member of the audience, thus blurring the boundaries between game and film. Language recognition software transforms the participant's answers via mobile phone into specific instructions. A specially developed software then processes these commands and launches an appropriate follow-up scene. The dialogue between the movie's main actress and an audience member leads to a different film - and outcome - every time: sometimes with a happy end, sometimes with a more gruesome one. To participate in the adventure, audience members submit their mobile phone numbers to a speed dial code when they buy their ticket. The moment the female protagonist takes out her phone to call someone who might be able to help her, the film's controlling software contacts one of the submitted mobile phone numbers. Once the viewer picks up, he hears the actress's voice - who tells him she would be lost without him. He has to help her escape by choosing a path through the old, rundown sanatorium. Furthermore, he also decides whether she should help other victims to flee the scene -and every single choice shapes her fate: it's a matter of life and death.",424003,13 street the channel for thrillers horror and crime the challenge the audience should experience horror as never before the idea the first interactive horror movie in theatres in regular horror movies the viewers role is always the same with 13th Street the horror film becomes an interactive thrill the view s play their own part and are able to communicate with the protagonists we develop a software that allows for such a dialogue by a voice recognition a flier invites viewers to send their phone numbers to a speed dial database the software selects an audience member and phones him or her then through voice recognition a dialogue between viewer and protagonists takes place hello hello - monster - this is what you've been right on yeah yeah okay the answers are converted into commands and the software plays out the corresponding scene because of this each caller creates a different film [Music] not only do the viewers hear the protagonists voice on the phone they experience her steps a breathing her entire fear up close parallel with the film thanks alright big so how could I want so a little timid don't go walk okay Maithili tones are they heaven order whatever vitae vitae [Music] yet space dude on Yaya [Music] Bono's in the film hit its target audience exactly film lovers at cinemas and festivals last call captured absolute attention aroused enthusiasm and effectively demonstrated the standards of 13th Street

EXPERIMENT: THE SOLAR CHARGING DUMMIES | Spies Rejser,"Exactly how much energy do you get from a sunny holiday? SPIES Travels built two solar charging dummies and sent them on two very different holidays to find out. The results were surprising.  One in four Danes experience winter depression and a study shows that 58% would like travel to warmer destinations to recharge. But are the Danes really solar powered? To find out we constructed two dummies at the Technical University of Denmark with 6.260 advanced flexible solar cells. We placed one in freezing Denmark and one in sunny Gran Canaria for seven days. Finally, two robots were used to test endurance and bed-stamina to demonstrate the effect of a good long holiday.

Teenage Dream | Sandy Hook Promise,"Gun violence shouldn’t be part of growing up. #TheTeenageDream https://www.sandyhookpromise.org/teenagedream  *** This video contains sensitive content related to gun violence that may be triggering for some viewers. ***  Sandy Hook Promise (SHP) is a national, nonprofit organization based in Newtown, Connecticut. We are led by several family members whose loved ones were killed in the tragic mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012, that claimed the lives of 20 first-graders and 6 educators. SHP is focused on preventing gun violence (and other forms of violence and victimization) BEFORE it happens by educating and mobilizing youth and adults on mental health and wellness programs that identify, intervene and help at-risk individuals. SHP is a moderate, above-the-politics organization that supports sensible non-policy and policy solutions that protect children and prevent gun violence. Our intent is to honor all victims of gun violence by turning our tragedy into a moment of transformation.

Nike - Dream Crazy (case study),"Don't ask if your dreams are crazy. Ask if they're crazy enough. Nike took a real, actual stand when it stood by controversial football player Colin Kaepernick in a powerful tweet and a subsequent two-minute film featuring the message, ""Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything"".   The move dropped Nike into the center of a cultural storm, but ultimately changed the marketing conversation and helped to propel sales, earning the brand several major awards. The overall ""Dream Crazy"" effort, which highlights how athletes have made their unbelievable aspirations a reality through hard work, perseverance and defiance, is part of the brand’s 30th anniversary celebration of the ""Just Do It"" tagline.

Commercial Weekend (1995) - Even Apeldoorn bellen - Centraal Beheer,"Een vermoeide zakenman vertrekt aan het eind van de week naar zijn optrekje op het platteland. De zware week in de stad houdt pas op als hij thuiskomt en de tv aanzet. Al zappend stuit hij op een hypnoseshow. En al lacht hij aanvankelijk nog schamper om de hypnotiseur, de yup laat zich wel verleiden om nog even naar deze zender te blijven kijken. En dat heeft onverwachte gevolgen.  Achtergrond commercial: De film 'Weekend' werd in 1995 opgenomen in de buurt van Los Angeles. De locatie is het landhuis van de dochter van de regisseur David Lynch, bekend van films als Blue Velvet en de televisieserie Twin Peaks. De speciale kleureffecten ontstonden door de film in zwart-wit op te nemen en later in te kleuren. 'Weekend' is een voorbeeld van de nieuwe weg die de 'Even Apeldoorn bellen' Studios halverwege de jaren negentig insloegen. Waarbij de humor intelligenter werd en de pechgevallen abstracter.

WallDecaux: Mercedes Key To Viano Campaign,"For their customer Mercedes-Benz Vans, Lukas Lindemann Rosinski implemented an interactive outdoor event on Wall AG's digital advertising displays in Berlin underground station Friedrichstrasse, which blurred the line between classical outdoor advertising and interactive entertainment. Under the slogan ""Key to Viano"", passers-by were offered the unprecedented opportunity to control digital advertising displays using their own remote car keys.  Together with technical- and software engineers, LLR developed a system which recognizes the remote car key signals via a radio receiver, informs the control unit of the digital LCD projectors and starts a new film clip each time a signal is received. To set the stage for this interactive event, centring around the 12 digital advertising displays opposite the platform, the underground station had to undergo a near complete redesign, accomplished in collaboration with WallDecaux Berlin.  Every time a remote car key -- no matter for which brand of car -- was operated, the side door of a digital Viano opened, and different kinds of passengers descended the vehicle: sometimes weird, sometimes colourful, sometimes from another world. But they all had one thing in common: They strikingly demonstrated the impressive capacity of the Viano's passenger compartment.  A passerby could, with a bit of luck, capture the film clip showing a Viano with chauffeur waiting for him. In this case, the Mercedes-Benz promotion team present on location invited the lucky winner to one of the Viano shuttles already waiting. The winner's journey then continued as an exclusive VIP ride to his or her Berlin destination.  Plenty of time for the winners and their companions to convince themselves of the many merits of the Viano.

Even though we’re desperate to.  With our wombs bleeding, and our bellies bloating, we’re half awake and half asleep. We’re hot and we’re cold, we struggle, we snuggle. We toss, we turn, we hold still, praying our pads stay in place. For too many a fear of stains stealing our sleep. We tiptoe to toilets while our partners, babies or pets sleep blissfully – is that awe or envy we feel? And all the while, lost sleep slips by – two hours a night, four nights a year, and months and months and months over our lives. It’s time to shine a light on what happens in the dark. For all of us braving the night, united without yet knowing. Because periods never sleep, but why shouldn’t we?  Join our quest for sleep #periodsomnia.                       Sleep Fearless.

Dove - Turn Your Back (case study),"Dove is encouraging people to 'turn their back' on the new Bold Glamour filter as part of its mission to create a #NoDigitalDistortion movement. The influencer-led campaign, developed by Ogilvy and DAVID, is kicking off with content creators sharing how they personally feel about the Bold Glamour filter and the damage it can do (and is doing) to social users. The Bold Glamour filter presents a concerning ideal of ‘beauty’ – one that looks real, too real. In the seven days since it launched, the hashtag has been viewed more than 365M times (probably more by now).   The campaign is galvanising people to stand together and physically turn their backs on this harmful form of digital distortion. Through research done by the Dove Self-Esteem Project 38% of girls in the US say they can’t live up to the beauty standards that influencers project on social media, and 80% say they have already applied a filter or used a retouching app to change the way they look in their photos by age 13. As a result, 48% of girls who distort their photos regularly have lower body esteem compared to 28% of girls who don’t. More detail in the attached release.  The filter launched while Ogilvy was hosting a global creative meeting with members of its creative community from around the world. The brief was put out as a Borderless Brief to the creative community and in less than 24 hours they agency had over 250 slides worth of ideas. The end result is a product of the borderless creativity that drives Ogilvy’s global creative network. In the end, the team rallied around the idea for #TurnYourBack, which was created by DAVID Madrid and Ogilvy UK with production assistance from DAVID São Paulo.  Liz Taylor, Ogilvy’s global chief creative officer, said, “The irony is not lost on me that I learned about this filter while standing in a room of global creatives talking about the ways we can use emerging technologies to create a positive impact. When technology penetrates culture in harmful ways, we have a moral obligation to stand up and take action. The Bold Glamour filter reinforces the toxic beauty standards that Dove has been working to abolish. Glamour has never been about conforming to just one look or one standard, and we need to galvanise people to take a stand against the damage that digital distortion is having on young people. Watching how our team came together with passion, fight, and true borderless creativity to take on this issue was a powerful example of how together we can change beauty.”  Firdaous El Honsali, global vice president of external communications at Dove, said, “While social media filters can be a source of creativity and self-expression, Bold Glamour goes beyond ‘play.’ Tools once only available to professionals can now be accessed by young girls at the touch of a button and without regulation. At Dove, we are committed to #NoDigitalDistortion in any of our marketing and advertising so that we can support a more positive environment on social media that is representative of real, authentic beauty. When young people distort their images, they distort their minds too. We are calling on our community to join us to turn their backs to the toxic Bold Glamour filter and stand up for real beauty. Because real beauty is bold!”  AWARDS Cannes Lions 2023 - Media Grand Prix  - 1 Gold in Media  - 1 Bronze in Social & Influencer    CREDITS  Brand: Dove (Unilever).

Boost Your Voice – Equal Voting Access for All,"Last election, millions of lower-income and minority voters were more likely to wait hours in long lines to cast their ballot, in part because they had fewer polling locations to serve them. Boost Mobile stores are located in these communities. So this election year, we’re launching a nationwide initiative for equal voting access, offering Boost stores across the country as polling places to help all Americans have an equal voice this November 8th and beyond. Get involved at http://www.BoostYourVoice.com and help spread the word about equal voting access.",61562,"There are already reports of problems at polling stations I ended up waiting in line for almost seven hours to vote I spent 9 hours in a gym packed full of hundreds and hundreds of people They said I was lucky one, 'cause I was the last one to vote. And have all these people here waiting that's unfair. Unequal voting access is definitely a problem in our country. Boost Mobile stores are located in the communities where these problems are happening. So we are offering our network of stores as polling places for election day. The more accessible places that are there for the minority communities the bigger the turnout could be on an election day. We're already implementing this program in a few innovative counties. Now we need your help to spread nationwide. If you believe we should all have an equal voice on November 8th, sign this petition... and help spread the word. Together, we can spark real change. And if you are a Board of Elections official in need of additional polling places, please contact us immediately. I would really question anybody that's not getting involved in this because it just makes sense. Voting has to be a fundamental right, no matter who the people are.

Burger King | WHOPPER SACRIFICE,"How many Facebook-friends do YOU have? If you have more than 150 would you describe yourself as superficial?    According to Professor Robin Dunbar @Oxford 150 is the limit to the number of relationships we actually can maintain. Although few of us actually interact with more than 5-6 people on Facebook on a daily basis we probably have well over this handfull of Facebook-friends.

A Personal Apology (Just for you),"Case Study Film: Lowe Roche.  This won a bronze in PR at Cannes Lions.   Due to a distribution problem in late 2010, o.b. tampons went off the shelves. Women were upset at the sudden loss of their brand, and we needed to apologize. So, we created a customized song and music video for each person on the o.b. database, and took the personalization of web content to a whole new level in the process. We recorded literally thousands of unique names for an original song, and displayed each name to spectacular visual effect in a tender ode called, A Personal Apology (just for you). After a remarkably positive response from both the target and the media, the video stands as a testament to successful crisis management and true corporate responsibility.",57034,"in 2010 a distribution problem meant that OB tampons were gone from the shelves with no other tampon like it on the market women had no option we needed to apologize to a very loyal user base so we sent a song and music video to each of these women personally all 65,000 and 10 of them Jenna and everyone else on the OB database received an email connecting them to their own personal apology Kanna I know we went away and let you down believe me when I say we wanna turn this thing around your name calling out your name again in case you didn't hear it the first time Jenna did is so name across the sky kill the you deserve the best and so take this coupon to the store [Music] we achieved a 61% email click-through rate then we invited users to share the video with friends so they could make an apology at their own and that's when a little sorry got big within three months we received over 1 million Facebook shares 1.8 million Twitter impressions nearly 1 million coupon downloads worldwide news placements and 27 million unique video views on our website all proving that it's never too late to say triple sorry a personal apology just for you"

Vodafone Red Light Application-Between Us Case Film,Team Red ile Vodafone'un ortaklığıyla hayata geçen kampanya.,55643,and a society where family is above everything else it's inappropriate for women to openly seek help Vodafone believes technology can be a powerful force for good so we created an app in which women could secretly seek help hidden in a flashlight app but if the user is in danger she can just shake her phone and the app automatically sends a message to three people she trusts along with her exact location to spread an app which works only if it's kept secret we hid our messages in places no man would ever see it like lingerie tags a partner shops wax strips female toilets even promoted female video bloggers on national TV to boost views online on their tutorial videos which contained our message hidden deep inside the content we estimated the secrecy with last 10 months then the app would slowly be exposed and become useless that's when we moved to phase 2 launching an update which turned the innocent flashlight into a mirror application once again using hidden messages to announce the change if any men would try to watch these videos we attempted to lure them with banners that would direct them elsewhere hidden inside a shareable Cosmetics discount the message appeared only when it was copy pasted all of vodafone female subscribers were informed through an automated voice system about the function of the app they were also given the option to share the voice message with their friends and help promote it the system recognized if a man answered the phone so instead he would hear a generic promotional offer from Vodafone as of today over two hundred and fifty four thousand women have downloaded the app that's twenty four percent of all women with smartphones in Turkey the app has been activated over a hundred and three thousand times we hope that one day the biggest success will be when we don't have to make any more versions of the app and no woman will ever have to download it again

Beyond Binary Code,Help rewrite the internet to be gender inclusive: https://www.spark.co.nz/online/beyondbinarycode/,54223,"If you've never questioned your gender you probably don't notice   how often you get gendered online but as a non-binary person it affects me every single day if a form has a field that's asking for someone's gender and there are only two choices   people are going to lie.  You are forced to choose male or female and then you're forced to misidentify yourself. If our data footprints don't reflect who we are we're forced to go invisible. That means every moment of our digital lives is created without us in mind. Being misgendered makes me feel whakamā, makes me feel shame. It can feel really lonely Beyond Binary is a piece of code that can be added to any website   rewriting the internet to be more inclusive Co-created with rainbow communities it helps   companies know when and how to ask for gender information It gives businesses true data on their customers, opening space for people like me. When I go on a website and they do have an option for non-binary   and the gender field is optional then I feel seen.  It's really cool when businesses do hold space for people like us.  It just allows people to be themselves.That's when I feel real euphoria and joy. I'm Jess I'm queer, I am a new mama. My name is Shanil Lal, I was born in Fiji.My pronouns are they/them. My name is Bode, I'm non-binary, and I write code. Ko Quack tēnei, 19 ōku tau.

Coleman Sweeney. World’s Biggest Asshole for Donate Life,"Donate Life America, an organ donation advocacy charity in the USA, is encouraging millennial men to become organ donors through “The World’s Biggest Asshole”, a humorous commercial starring obnoxious character Coleman F Sweeney.

"Nokia's ""The World's Biggest Signpost""","Nokia wants to ""make navigation into something social"" so they took to the streets of London and erected the worlds biggest signpost.     For more inspiration visit http://www.helloyoucreatives.com    Created by FarFar for Nokia 2010   For more information http://www.farfar.se/work/nokia/the-worlds-biggest-signpost/",51322,when people think about navigation they don't think about nokia so Nokia called for an idea that would not only drive interest into knock his navigation products but more importantly inspire people to start using the services both on their phones and on the web but most people see mobile navigation as something that gets you from pay to B and it's not very fun or engaging so what if you could turn things around and make navigation into something social a channel where you can share your favorite places your good things to do this we found a solution based on the simplest idea around right in the middle of one of London's busiest areas next to the iconic Tower Bridge we started building one of the world's largest interactive installations we are putting a crane up which will have a large arrow suspended from the bottom of it yeah big arrow in the center of London no it's the first time I've done that my only issue is we're relatively close to London Airport nothing at hugging the 60-ton interactive structure reached 50 meters tall with an arrow the size of to London double deckers completely multiples per turn 360 degrees and pointing out people's favorite locations all around the world people on the street could use their phones and text the location directly to the signpost and within moments the giant would turn and display the direction and distance tool a good thing and through four webcams place around the site the installation was streamed live on Tanaka comm with a live stream was synced with a good things map so people could explore all the locations on the signpost inside Nokia's online navigation service they could also add their own location to the signposts by dropping a pin on the good things map and of course you could follow the signpost through its own good things feed on Twitter during the two weeks when the signpost is live thousands of locations were displayed added by the public either through the web or through text messages and on the Internet the installation picked up plenty of it's a physical installation that is powered by the public oh through the web and through their phones an idea that redefines navigation from something that only gets you from A to B into something fun and engaging and we based it on the simplest idea around only this time we made it 50 meters tall and completely motorized and put the controls right under your thumb

gets done every day take the kitchen for this map three times a day easy i'm very young to be in a stock company with four years on but there's a couple guys maybe three and a half so we're all like junior men we're grouping each other together my desire to be a fireman started when i was a little child before everything else that's all i ever wanted to do but something inside me said i wanted to be a fireman but that was the only direction i had in life to be a fine man so rewarding you know you don't see in the paycheck but you really feel it like uh i i basically been living here you know

the glorious part of the job i mean in the sink somebody's got it there's the amount of time you get the least desirable jobs there's no sense complaining about anything because you know if you see something that has to be done you complain you can't complain about it just do it do it yourself you know just cleaning the sinks up or mopping the floors or whatever is a lot of pride and you do it because you love being here be your kitchen [ __ ] right now you know if i take the time not to clean this up and do a good job of cleaning it maybe that's a reflection upon everything else i do you can't be passing it on to the next guy you got to do it if you see something that needs to be done you take care of it the whole job is young you know the entire fire department is young [Music] some people think that i'm a young captain 11 of our guys came after september 11 2001 because we lost we lost six members that were killed and um we lost four guys for promotion i lost three guys to retirement so i have 11 guys that are new to the squad since uh september 11th we're just in a transitional stage never replaced those guys that we lost but we just through training and through diligence we'll get back up to that same level it's tough for new guys because they come into something that they want to come to this company but they just they're coming at not such a good time for a new guy to come it wasn't it wasn't coming under a time where we have a lot of problems we're dealing with the loss of our guys the last thing we want to do is train new guys at that at that point last year and it has been difficult and it has been guys it has been it has been a growing pain because like you said not only you're dealing with raw emotions you know from the tragedy but you're also dealing with human instincts like you know i want to still fit in i want to be able to prove myself but it's hard because you're not only doing it on a physical level you know you're doing it on an emotional level too because now i want greg to like me as much as he liked his friends prior to here there was people who were deaf who would who were killed from top to bottom and the bottom line is the perseverance from everybody capable of of of growing and getting back to where it was before september 11th this is what we used to use it's a chalkboard we used to use for our riding list that's the riding list from september 11 those are the guys that they're less their last tour right now we just have the piece of plexiglas screwed in so nobody can erase it or mess with it but we're gonna try to figure out a way to permanently preserve it one two three four five chats he's driving fees got the can hank you got the irons and you hooked up with mike you got the hook control terry you got the roof first thing we gotta do we gotta drill at 10 30 saratov building we're gonna do standpipe operations and then uh rescue of a missing fine [Music] guys listen up here's a scenario we got a report of a fire it's a fireproof building 60 70 and 80. that's the dispatcher's report you're gonna be the engine you're gonna be the truck so you've got okay you guys can go stand pipe's in the other stairwell i'm going up to seven [Music] go hit hit hit hold up you're going right you're going left stay the left wall okay don't let that door close behind you go go ahead 18 you got it 2 5 to eighteen we got the fire back [Music] [Applause] here keep coming back you got another 10 feet you're going to go that way and the front door is right there go go [Applause] that was your basic forcible entry drill you know how to force a door how to perform a search how to stretch your hose line and how to get somebody out right from day one to probably school you know you're you're putting a squad and there's there's the whole concept of teamwork you have to have a team you can't do it alone you know no one man is as good alone as we all are as a team and if i have to even at roll call locally you'll get together in the group you decide what you're going to do for the day as a group you clean the tools as a group you're doing everything as a group but like we said before when you go out the door and now you go into a fire now it's that life and death situation where that teamwork could mean the difference between life and death the day you raise your hand and take that oath to do this job is the day the brotherhood begins that's that's the day it starts because you still you got guys standing to the left and to your right and those are the guys that are either you're depending on them or they're depending on you for you and your life is in their hands and their life is in your hands exactly it helps to like them you know you don't you you're just here for a 24 or you're here for a tour but it's impossible to like everybody you work with but once the tones go off you leave all that stuff behind in the firehouse and you go out and you do your job bus chops for a reason you know uh to teach you things to teach your responsibility in the fire has to do you know that you're going to be responsible for somebody that you're with you know you have to do your job and see it through to the end and that seems to be the way we all learn around here [Applause] spice up your life every day is a new experience here i'm the lowest of low i'm just the probing can't do much you can't say much it's just the brotherhood that's what it's about hey you guys are probably anybody say you could talk cornflakes catfish it's bronco's specialty he was a part of the crew that was working september 11th and uh he didn't know how to cook because he was a single guy that uh lived by himself for a long time cooking meals that you know were favorites of some of the guys that were here that passed away makes you feel good makes you remember them brings back uh good memories was that too hot for you man there's something about hot metal i've seen it you should have been a cop traditionally you start out in an engine you know you get your sea legs and uh you graduate usually to the truck you start doing truck work whereas it's more individualized more specialized you have more responsibilities in the truck and then you know then you go to the rescue where uh you know you uh have a ton more responsibilities you've got all sorts of extra training pretty much somebody gets stuck somewhere you have to go get them you know no matter where it is who's down the hall anybody down the hall yeah we're just recreating real training conditions here that's all got to make it as real as possible you set a fire down straddle your hole there's no turning around the whole lead it's a bit tight so which side okay i see the ladder yeah watch the loud as you go down yep i mean but if you wanted to do a nice quick repel really can't do it you know yeah right right ah back to work guys all right you guys just stay there and talk i'll be okay you guys are funny huh not too bad though they missed kind of okay guys i got it all right i'm done all right fellas that is they're actually pretty fortunate the engine because the rescue company we have a lot of experienced guys and they have a wealth of knowledge across the floor that they can pick from every guy's duty as a fireman is to pass on experience to the new guys you're if you're not doing that as far as i'm concerned you're not doing your job you know if anybody hasn't told you these only get used as a last resort as a backup yeah you do bring guys in there you go to fires with them or you tell them about special things to watch out for things that are going to save their lives things that senior guys told me when i got onto john ritchie when we got on there was guys like that that told us hey listen kid you know uh when you get up on a smoky roof get down on your knees and crawl around you know you don't want to walk off the edge of the building you know or you know just little tips and hints how to force stores you know little things that maybe they didn't show them in probe school a lot of this job is experience that's passed down from the senior guys and there's a big change with the promotions guys retiring and that's that's not just in this house that's that's the entire job and uh it's such a big transition through this job right now that uh you're nervous for you know anybody who's operating at the scene because you know that that experience level has dropped and only time is going to make that stronger somebody's under the trade [Applause] oh didn't make it there's not really much for us to do it's just a just a clump and it's like i don't know maybe torsion maybe [Music] [Music] [Laughter] work [Music] all right you want to just go up here and i'll come out and walk them down basically it was a transit worker that was hit when he put up the signals for safety signals now it's a crime scene and the pd will take over and take photographs and they'll have to remove the body and stuff you'd be surprised how many people do it in the city like joel it's unbelievable yeah 35 a month doing this stuff for 14 years you know right away whether you cut out for it first time you go to something like that you know dismemberment or whatever happens [Music] you know whether or not you're cut out for it you know i had a couple of them tell me they say to me tell my wife i love them and all that kind of stuff you know that's kind of hard you know you know this guy's last words he knows it too all right let's go we're out of here [Music] friday night in a big city seems pretty quiet though right laid back for friday night yeah there you go so you just put the like on it this is the night shift this is the uh 6 p.m to 9 a.m in the morning night tour normally the engine companies and the truck companies they take care of what needs to be done uh we're there in case uh but a lot of times we get used because of things being quite a bit different more complicated uh more intense more involved uh and uh they we get used for those situations well i like to kid all my friends that uh that work in other boroughs that i work in the city and they work in the suburbs even though brooklyn used to be its own city and is a rather large and unique place on its own but for my way of thinking manhattan is where it's at we don't have the frequency of fires but we have more emergencies than the other places just because there's so many people here now with terrorism and radiation and biohazards and weapons of mass destruction we're the ones that are going to fight the battle in the streets the september 11th the captain who was assigned here was killed and they asked me if i'd like to come down here and i accept it and uh i consider it a great honor to be here uh it's it's a challenge it's a challenging place to work i've been underneath the top parts of bridges i've been in tunnels i've been in collapsed buildings i've been in submerged vehicles on top of skyscrapers in tenements inside of tanks whatever could happen eventually happens around here [Applause] [Music] aggressive interior attack get in the building push the fire out of the building rather than go outside the building and push the fire in so we go in and we aggressively attack the fire and push it push it out and put it out you got cell down here let's go squad eyes squat okay we're in the basement can we knock down the main body of fire down here we got the body of fire knocked down it's just charging we need ventilation [Laughter] itself is a force to reckon with you have to respect it man it'll take you in two seconds has no conscience i've always been in the ghetto for 23 years and uh i never worked in a well-to-do neighborhood there's a lot of fire activity in brooklyn as we say it's the borough of fire it's a good place for young guys to come because you'll learn how to be firemen here a little quicker than anywhere else i really don't like to call it ghetto firehouse because generally neighborhood is uh it's just a poor neighborhood most part i've been here on 79 and this neighborhood specifically bushwick is the second poorest in the city consequently there's a lot of fires and there's a lot more situations that you have to deal with it's a little more busy than a lot of other places it's a little more exciting and everybody seems to want to be in a place like this or a place in the neighborhood like this that belt goes off you get on the rig you hear that radio code 10.75 get some adrenaline pumping you got 100 pounds of equipment on you you just run through walls and jump from building a building from fire escape the fire escape the unknown is exciting every fire is different every fire is unique you know it starts in the basement it can start in the cockpit it gets started anywhere you need all your senses out of fire you need to hear it you need to feel it need to see it you can smell it actually fire has a life and it actually speaks lisa to me it does and you want to fight it so you're constantly fighting the devil when you're in the fire if you really listen to a fire it has a sound and it sounds devilish it's starting to boil and it sounds like it's talking to you and it's you don't like it it's kind of unnerving it's kind of hot it's kind of scary but you know you notify it's going to go out and you've got to get in there and put it out because you might save somebody's life so you don't stop [Music] let's face it we're not supposed to be going in there you know everything in human nature tells you don't go in and that doesn't make us actually sane people you know a lot of firemen are insane good insane but they're insane because you know it don't make a whole lot of sense to do what we do sometimes underneath all the rough exterior and all the rough rough crap that you'll see a lot of there's got to be some caring you got to care for other people you won't get a lot of guys to admit that you know but you gotta otherwise why would you do it [Applause] you want to cut that actually i do if you don't mind yeah you can cut it if you want wait just cut the breast see what it looks like inside oh she's not done she's sick i don't know bro it's close it's november 28th thursday thanksgiving day guys with younger children get off for the holiday all right like tommy's our senior guy he's stepped up to work so somebody else that has younger children can have the day off i'm sure some of the guys wanted to be home with their families i know i did but again luck of the draw and how the truck falls the guys that are new to the company they get a guy that's got time in the house they'll step up to work for them you know just out of respect for the senior man you know but um yeah that's what's happening tonight i believe there's a couple of guys working for a couple other guys and that can go under the bunk for now and we'll set it up in the office window later captain metcalf's playing father let me tell you because with the crew we got tonight one and one it's like a bunch of kids he's got one putting out the finest silverware we have with the nice napkins doilies [Applause] paul can you do anything what the first pie that's in the oven can you pull just check the thing for me please i want this put it on the stove are you putting whipped cream on this though no that's for dinner this is going to be for your dog thanks for coming in early bro do the right thing i want to relieve the uh senior man so i get tommy bart 24 year man fireman so i want to get him home so you know plus i miss these guys they're like a toothache did you bring the crazy boat no i didn't bring them great this is a writing list every every day we come in we have to fill out a writing list it tells you what's your position today is the the date 9 28 it's 11 28 i think today's the day tour and the officer is lieutenant macla i'm the chauffeur seated chauffeur is norton that's my nickname as in honeymooners you're going to the moon alice just go to any fire department function and say norton and they'll know who you're talking about in any borough and any any fire department functions norton is known this is a halogen tool right here and this is the most important tool in the truck this forces doors pull ceilings takes windows you break windows with it you can force doors with it you put it in and use it as a crowbar you can use a can opener method first norton is good he's good at what he does and second because he's got he's got a unique personality he likes to have fun when he works i mean when the bell rings and then it's blowing out a couple of windows he's not funny then he's one of the best farmer i've ever worked with the can has about three gallons of water to press this handle and it comes out so every position is key the roof man gets his gets the roof uh the forcible entry team forces the door finds the fire the engine stretching the line the guys behind them are changed changing chasing the kinks hooking up getting water and that's teamwork and if it if everyone does their job usually the job goes like clockwork oh oh oh god appetite bro probably not an appetizer something wrong with you bro you would definitely there's definitely something wrong with you pork chop open this door well get the key and open the door we have the same training as rescue but the rescue does not have the hazmat rig that's all the special equipment that nobody else has other than the squad and this is the stuff that we were specially trained on and this is what makes us unique this is a level a hazardous materials entry suit need this to enter a hot zone of the hazardous materials unit this protects you you put your scott cylinder on first so you you have uh inhalation protection and you're inside your suit you obviously have protection from absorption this gives you the maximum level of protection the squads and the hazmat units are the only ones that carry them this is the kids end though the adults are on this end where's some of this stuff that's carrot part [Applause] it's it's trust me what is this i don't know [Applause] [Applause] thanksgiving dinner it's a gas leak in the cellar over there pretty routine we just came at the perfect time you knew when we were to sit down for thanksgiving thanksgiving dinner you knew that that was it you know bless the lord for this security prophecy from the abandoned christian letter amen amen nice job you missed grace god said who said it do you want to say it he stood in for you [Applause] this is a fork put the food on the floor is okay here's the deal i work here joel works here our friend frank was downstairs but i think he fell off the ladder so you're gonna have to go down and get this guy any questions you have about the space or the mechanical equipment around here you can ask joel or myself all right on your toes ready hands over your head don't put yourself okay nice we acknowledge seniority the more fires you go to the more time you put on the job the more you know the more valid valuable you are to a company senior man is almost like a title paul is the one who's been here the longest and knows the most about the place therefore his knowledge is very valuable so we all rely on it as well as 10 minutes on air all right get him out of there now all right come on come on come on come on let's go let's go keep going come on come on come on come on it's a great diet daniel let's go fast come on up slow 10 feet from the top low slow hold slow up slow [Music] all right very good the one decided advantage you have when you're working in the company is that you have guys with different levels of training where as soon as you get there somebody's going to know right what to do hopefully and in a short time that'll be you when you pull up this is not going to be long until you're the senior guy happens to everybody we're kind of like lifers people put a lot of time uh i put a good part of my life in this fire department that's for the snake guy and it boils down to your rank your seniority and the most important thing is your reputation your reputation is the big thing and it takes a long time to build a good one and you can lose it very fast if you have a good rep and you're respected uh that's basically the highest uh form of praise you can give somebody that he's a good fireman [Applause] [Music] doesn't get any better than that that's the kind of people we all want to work with you want everyone to be able to take care of you you're going to take care of them and and together we take care of the people that can't help themselves uh regarding uh falling debris we ready on the head a two by four actually fell from like maybe up on the uh 10th floor approximately and when it fell down i wanted a construction worker was standing by and it actually struck him he elevated five flights up and then he got to go up uh you never know hope we go to the next [Music] endeavor [Music] that was audi he wanted to know if we needed a messenger van to get the guys back and forth to the community board meeting tonight what do you think of the fact that chatzi didn't shave this morning about his legs don't you think you should change it [Laughter] what an improvement you're going through so i'm not going to do that god bless you hey give me a kiss big boy thanks for taking some strides police say the fire was set at 7 41 thursday morning in a tailor shop possibly by a former employee 15 fire units responded although engine 44 isn't one of the eight fire houses the fdny has slated for closing it might be replaced with a squad company that responds not just to local but citywide calls firefighters hope thursday's performance helps convince top brass that's a mistake 8 44. [Applause] they do at 8 30 in the morning in front of the firehouse the upper east side do you think they're going to let us start finding sauce if they move us to the upper east side which is one of their proposals then community port 4 would have no engines whatsoever the best way to win this is to hit the public hit the council your political activists and do it that way because that's the only way we're going to win it so we're expecting hopefully a big turnout of the community and support for 252. [Applause] they're moving three fire houses from our neighborhood not one in manhattan three from brooklyn this building 218 schaefer street has been burned down six times in five years due to arson a man burned in that building a mexican man burned in that building but they saved his wife and his three kids this firehouse that they're getting rid of this area is called the dark side of bushwick the most poor side of bushwick but yet they removed three or five houses from here so tonight at 195 um wilson we're going to have a community meeting we're going to try to stop the removal of this firehouse can everyone please sign in we collecting signatures and petitions to help keep the firehouse open this is a big fight we're gonna need to help everybody in this room uh without further ado i'd like to introduce fellow commander coletta from the new york city fire department thank you anna gonzalez who's the chairperson of community board 4. thank you what we're going to do now is open up the questions and answer tonight a little girl had an asthma attack right next to my house they called it five o'clock cause i was right out front of the house at 505 252 was there giving the little girl oxygen the evidence didn't come for 20 minutes later who else would have been there when who's going to be there when you take them to manhattan [Applause] they gave us two reasons why they're moving this company 252 from central avenue one is finance then they turn around and says because of some terrorist attack it doesn't take any longer for squad 252 to get to manhattan because you know when they left here that day they were in manhattan and died in that collapse with some of the guys got there first so it doesn't take that long now what i want to know is what is the reason for moving the company is it financial or is it because of the terrorist attack the mayor gave us a mandate we had to cut our budget the only way to get the money that they wanted was to close eight companies as far as i know it's not a plan it's not a conspiracy to drive your neighborhood of fire protection none will close i think in manhattan so i i just interesting hold on one second [Applause] my name's ed metcalf i'm the captain of squad company 252 and i just liked it [Applause] [Music] there's a question that uh i haven't had answered yet by the city and i was just hoping chief clutter was all due respected maybe you could look into the answer to this 1998 they reinstituted the squad concept and they reopened squads throughout all the boroughs they tried at that time to open a squad on the upper east side they've tried several times since to open a squad on the upper east side my question is this how come now all of a sudden they want to take an existing squad and take it from where it is and put it on the upper side is it financing is it because of the terrorist attack and i can't give you that answer [Music] but they can't take 252 from us they can't i remember the first time i walked into this house they were making the squad they were looking for uh lieutenants to come here and i walked it and i just had a good feel i just had a good feeling this firehouse walking in this is where i wanted to finish up i got promoted i came back to the house i got promoted and uh this is where i want to finish up my career a fire is a fire um a firehouse is a firehouse and this is home you know you come here this is home 42 hours out of the week this is home what they're doing right now is tearing them tearing the heart out unfortunately they know when i say they being counters know that no matter what they do to this job they're still gonna have a hundred guys for every one spot on the guys on the outside that want to be a fireman for the one spot that's there it's very competitive around here about getting in and guys getting on a rig real fast and uh when you're an old dog like me it's it's we're never going to let the traditions die the traditions are in here or in here but again we're firemen and we all do what we're told when it comes down to and if it does come down to it push comes to shove and they move us we're going to go such a handsome man [Music] california portland oregon from all over famous falls it is all right congratulations thank you very much thank you so much good to meet you thanks for taking time out thank you thank you we'll see you guys thank you when i was a young teenage boy growing up as a firefighter and all throughout the country there was a couple of rescues right in a close period of time that paul was involved in that made the whole country aware of paul hashagan one was the news helicopter crash when he rescued the news reporter and the pilot from the helicopter paul was the rescue diver that went out he went down not once but twice he went down first got the reporter brought her up and then he went down again to get the pilot out of the helicopter and i was just a young kid then and uh so paul was like a legend and then be able to come here and work with him was pretty cool good luck good luck in your time he's probably one of the most decorated firemen in the city of new york we're losing now it's sort of like i can't go to the old guy and uh make some information out of him so i mean that makes it tough there you know you're really in the hot seat now that's the way i feel [Applause] it's another been working on this mural for a long time i guess i'm putting some finishing touches on everybody that's been assigned to the company's on the wall that would be captain morris he's noted for training firefighters across the country and how to get through doors and specifically how to get through locks i think that might be me it doesn't have my name on it but i believe that's my uh likeness joel's on the wall over there above that sign worked with joel several years now and he has to be one of the smartest guys i've ever worked with so he gave him a little bit of einstein's knowledge in his hands hey it's the brain i'm over here with taking notes me and my duck i'll miss the guys but i get to see the guys i'll miss the house but i get to visit the house but i'll miss driving that truck it's hard to get close you got to kind of like just slide it right in and cut it deep oh look the truck it's his first words his truck yeah he's going to work out nice here today's my last day so you can drive tonight on okay this is the tougher side to cut the pulley on the saw you ready slide it right and cut it deep yeah you're the best driver we have drive the fork right under there and pull it in bye bye bye you're still gonna come and see the other firemen right sure she's joel yeah you're the best buzz there's a little boy that lives next door and has taken a shine to the truck for 25 years i did this and i was successful at it i'm going out on my own terms and so far i'm not seriously injured and a lot of my friends aren't with me anymore that just by the way things happened on one day so i'm getting out of here in one piece and alive and i'm grateful for that so just think when i had my time in there i did a good job and and i had the respect of the guys i work with and i can ask for more than that wait a minute it's elizabeth look how skinny i look to be nick [Applause] i'll be um the senior guy at uh rescue one as of six o'clock this to trucking is paul is a big loss i don't know whether a lot of people realize that we lost a lot of senior guys in that you know tragedy so it's not too many left in the job be a tough drive should i have to come tomorrow right well i'm going to be here i'm glad of that joel you got it [Music] thank you very much thanks a lot don't put them down yeah your name's already gone from the box

Can an alphabet preserve a culture?,"The language of the Fulani people of West Africa, known as Pulaar, is spoken by over 40 million people, but for most of history, the language had no alphabet. Determined to preserve their native language since they were children, the Barry brothers created ADLaM, a handwritten alphabet for their people.   Yet the need remained to digitize the alphabet so it could be used to communicate in the modern digital world, empowering the Fulani people to conduct business, connect through social media and find information in their own language.   Though the brothers had developed early versions of the digital typeface, for the Fulani community to fully adopt and embrace it, the alphabet needed to be optimized and made more widely available in digital spaces. In partnership with the brothers and a group of expert typeface designers we created a revised version of the alphabet that was easier to read and write. Importantly, the new typeface was updated to include new letter forms that take into account how the alphabet has naturally evolved within the Fulani community.   Microsoft has now integrated the redesigned alphabet across their global platforms. The revised version of the alphabet is now available to download on unlocked.microsoft.com as the ADLaM Display font and will be deployed natively across the Microsoft 365 suite of programs, desktop and mobile.  Subscribe to Microsoft on YouTube here: https://aka.ms/SubscribeToYouTube    Follow us on social:   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/microsoft/   Twitter: https://twitter.com/Microsoft  Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Microsoft/   Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/microsoft/      For more about Microsoft, our technology, and our mission, visit https://aka.ms/microsoftstories",45745,"The Fulani people of West Africa are the world’slargest nomadic group. Pulaar, their native tongue, had always been a spoken languagebut didn’t have an alphabet. Forced to use other alphabets,the meaning and nuances of their words began to vanish along with their traditions,stories and songs. While illiteracy grew. Two young brothers, Ibrahima and AbdoulayeBarry, refused to accept it. And, letter by letter, created an alphabetfor their people. But it only existed in a handwritten form, making it limitedin the modern digital world. We would close our eyes and draw shapesbased on the sounds of our language. Even though we created ADLaM, to make it accessible,it has to be on computers. Working in partnershipwith the Barry Brothers. We completed the encoding of the alphabet,and finally the Fulani were able to type their languageon their computers. Being able to use your language onthe computer is so fundamental. If you don't have that, you just shut offfrom the world that we function in. But as the digital world kept evolving,major revisions were needed in order to make the alphabeteasier to read and write. It takes hundreds of years for letter formsto take their final forms, but Microsoft is helping usspeed that process. Working with typefaceexperts, the letter forms of the alphabet were revised,creating a new and optimized version. Then we made itavailable on PCs around the world. We knew that making ADLaMavailable on Microsoft 365 was going to be enormously significant to the Fulani peopleand the preservation of their language. And the community embraced it for their businesses, their communications,and to teach the generations to come. Perpetuating Fulani culture forever. My culture was about to disappear but now with the ADlamalphabet it’ll remain in writing forever."

City of Chicago - Boards of Change (case study),"Boards of Change brought America’s disenfranchised voices from the streets to the polls. Plywood boards that barricaded storefronts during the Black Lives Matter protests, filled with messages of unity and justice, were turned into voting booths.   They inspired residents in dozens of Chicago’s low-turnout neighborhoods to create systemic change through the power of their vote and enabled them to register. Amplified by outdoor, social media, and national PR, Boards of Change empowered Black Americans to know their vote counts and helped Chicago attain a record number of registrations and voters. #BoardsOfChange   Main Awards - Black Pencil at the D&AD 2021, in the category ""Spatial Design: Public Spaces""  - Grand Prix ""Best of Discipline"" for Design at the One Show 2021  - Media Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions 2021   CREDITS  Agency: FCB Chicago.

The Blu Dot Real Good Experiment: Film,"When we opened our SoHo store in 2008, we were introduced to the resourceful culture of ""curb-mining"": the act of finding furniture and art on the street. Now that a year has passed, we decided to conduct a curb-mining experiment of our own.    On November 4-5, 25 Real Good Chairs were dropped around NYC, free for the take. Many were GPS-enabled. Watch the film to see what happened.",34736,[Music] what is good was his goodness is it formal design is it usefulness is it something abstract these questions LED blue dot to embark on an experiment perhaps to get a real honest answer to a simple question [Music] we wondered what would happen if we left a real good chair alone on the street so we devised an experiment first we assembled a bunch of brightly colored chairs to be placed in a bunch of different locations on the streets of New York carefully selecting a design that is well-crafted understated ly modern and stylish so that it is desirable to the greatest number of potential unidentified you chair owners or Poncho's who we could easily monitor from the top of the nearby building and have the best view of any identified new chair owner or Inco who takes the chair then we track the new chair owners back to their homes by GPS to get a real honest answer to our question [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] limited field of view so please call out any potential Funko's as they approach leave the P in panco stands for potential that's an affirmative senior gentleman considering the chair I [Music] [Music] think it's a credit to the chair how comfortable the gentleman looks good work everybody we have some strong possible vodkas approaching from the south north I think we have some interest [Music] [Music] anybody have eyes on Red Robin on the move go for big there I'm getting GPS do scientists extraordinary force we were able to track our chairs by GPS which at the aid of monocytes we built it inconspicuously hit on the bottom of all our chairs we started by looking for how all of the parts intersected a battery a bunch of wires the GPS device and then we basically took all those parts and hack them together and then reassembled it and then we're sticking it on the bottom of the chair when someone fixed up the chair they'll activate a tilt switch which will turn on the GPS tracking so when that happens the chair will locate satellites and then it will start broadcasting its location and all we have to do to complete our experiment is to travel to the incas house ring his or her buzzer and like to ask for an interview well we work for the chair company oh hello yeah did you take a chair of the street the other day yeah terrific you see we're having an experiment have you ever been the subject of an experiment before I'm a furniture maker and a woodworker make the furniture in cabinets fashion design student how often do you find real good things on the street you find some really good stuff well I found many things I found a keyboard mirror from a store display that I just loved the shape of it I don't quite know what I'm gonna use it for but it's sort of interesting my bank on 68th and Broadway there was a girl sitting on this red chair as she's leaving to go back to the bank I asked her what's with the chair and she says simply take it if you wanted I look around and say why not why would I leave it I tested it it looked strong it held me I carried it west toward my home which is about two blocks three blocks away why did you take the chair it's for my son and it's mine but I'm going to bring it to my son tomorrow I can sit for like takes a long time to come up with something good nunya has Todd ever made a good thing for you the lady both for me so I could rich things in the house and it's my favorite color which is the favorite color of the cherry Thunder mister very often I have to go to my neighbours and borrow the chair said this is one less chair I need to borrow because it's now mine but after that I think maybe George will take it I think he likes to play his guitar in it that's a good chair other Thrones away all right yeah it's surprising but I suppose in this day and age it's only a matter of time until something like this happens to each one I really have a hard time putting any object that has a useful life in the garbage should be given a home it's not my home I know people who might need a chair [Music] you [Music]

PedidosYa - World Cup Delivery (case study),"Argentina is a country that’s completely crazy about Football. After 36 years of waiting, with many lost finals, this could be Lionel Messi’s last chance to win the World Cup. And it finally happened. Argentina broke a spell that lasted more than 3 decades. The country exploded in excitement like never before. In that context, people were obsessed with one thing: When would the trophy arrive in the country so they could celebrate?  STRATEGY In a moment of total madness, where every brand was trying to jump on the success of the national team, and when it was very hard to be relevant, we focused our strategy on the anxiety every Argentinian was living. As soon as Argentina became World Champion, we detected a general increase in people's interest to know about the arrival of the World Cup. Instead of an expensive media strategy, we decided to use our own platform to reach more than half of the population of the country.  IDEA In the middle of the celebrations of the World Cup winning, PedidosYa sent to half of the country a “fake” delivery notification to their phones reading: “Your order is on the way”. Millions of users panicked, thinking their account had been hacked, or they had been scammed. But when they opened it, all that anguish turned into joy. It turns out that the notification took them to the map inside the app that usually tracks the order. But this time, it was directly linked to real time data that tracked the flight that brought the champions together with the World Cup Trophy to the country. This way, they could follow the journey from Qatar to Argentinian soil in real time through their phones.  EXECUTION When Argentina became champions of the world, we put our hands to work. With a no code system and the help of AI, we used the API from Google Maps, and at the same time the API from Flight Aware, which shows the real time locations of every flight in the world. This way be were able to track the flight in real time and visualize it in the PedidosYa ecosystem  So right as the airplane lifted off Qatar’s soil all PedidosYa users got a notification in their phones that said: “Your order is on the way”. The notification was linked to the PedidosYa app, where everyone could follow this time, instead of a cheeseburger, the World Cup’s journey home with the players.  RESULTS  In the 30+ hours it took to deliver the World Cup from Qatar to Argentina, we were able putting the brand in everyone's mouth. When Argentina’s national team and Messi both had reached the greatest glory, PedidosYa had more mentions than both of them, becoming the #1 trending topic. We had a reach of more than 25 million (more than half the country). It was the most viral World Cup brand action. And all with 0 dollar investment in media.

"Heinz - ""Hidden Spots"" campaign (case study)","Ketchup brand Heinz  partners with streamers to find ""safe spaces"" for gamers to snack in 'Call of Duty: Warzone'. For gamers, it’s hard to keep focused during an online match if you’re also trying to trying to eat at the same time. So to help players of the first-person shooter game 'Call of Duty: Warzone' enjoy a mid-game meal in peace, condiment brand Heinz mapped out safe spaces they could hide out in while they were eating.  The Heinz ""Hidden Spots"" campaign, created by agency Gut São Paulo, identified remote in-game locations on Warzone Caldera (the latest map and update for 'Call of Duty: Warzone'), a free-to-play game that pits 150 players against each other on a single map to be the last one standing.  Heinz partnered with Activision (the gaming company behind Call of Duty) on the campaign, which was announced ahead of the new Caldera map launch. The brand promoted the campaign with a 30-second spot that showed a gamer eating a burger while playing 'Call of Duty: Warzone', only to be killed in the game. Heinz also shared social media posts across TikTok, Twitter and Instagram.  Heinz then teamed up with multiple YouTube and Twitch streamers who shared the best spots to snack safely in the game. During the live streams on 17 to 19 December, each gamer explored the new 'Call of Duty: Warzone' map as they ate a burger and fries with their very own custom bottle of Heinz Tomato Ketchup. The streamers included British YouTuber Vikram Singh Barn (who has 7.45 million subscribers), Brazilian esports player Rafael ‘Rakin’ Knittel (who has 1.5 million Twitter followers) and Chilean esports player bstrdd.   The campaign was eventually extended beyond 'Call of Duty: Warzone' to include other popular games, including 'Fortnite', 'Player Unknowns Battlegrounds' and 'Counter-Strike: Global Offensive'.  RESULTS  The video announcing the campaign now has more than 1.2 million views on YouTube. According to the agency, paid media accounted for more than 29,000 interactions and 56.6 million impressions, with earned media extending this to more than 24,000 interactions and 51 million impressions. In total, more than 150 Heinz ""Hidden Spots"" were mapped.  AWARDS This campaign has won the following awards:  - One Show 2022: the Interactive, Online & Mobile Grand Prix.  ...

Partners Life - The Last Performance (case study),"New Zealand life insurance provider, Partners Life, has partnered with Special New Zealand to deliver a disruptive advertising campaign, The Last Performance, challenging Kiwis to rethink preconceptions around life insurance.  Over the past six weeks, Partners Life ads have aired at the end of each episode of Kiwi whodunnit drama, The Brokenwood Mysteries, using the characters and plotlines to integrate the storyline into the ads.  Following episode one, for example, before the credits rolled, the 30-second spot aired featuring Kiwi actress Meryl Main, who played Janis, the first murder victim of the series.  As Janis’s corpse comes back to life, she looks down at the camera to lament the unexpected nature of death, saying, “Well this is unexpected...what are my boys going to do without their mummy now, sorry lads there’s no life insurance policy”.  The ad spot ends by encouraging viewers to ‘plan ahead and get life right’ with Partners Life. Throughout the series, similar tongue-in-cheek ads from Partner’s Life aired, with a bespoke film created to play at the end of each episode in the six-part series.  The ad series has been brought to life by Special New Zealand and aims to bring about a new awareness and consideration for the importance of life insurance and jolt New Zealanders out of apathy and into action.  Naomi Ballantyne, managing director at Partners Life says the creative and humorous approach to an often overlooked and sometimes morbid topic like life insurance is just what is needed to grab Kiwis’ attention: “New Zealand is, unfortunately, one of the most under-insured countries in the world. We want to change that and help Kiwis to understand just how important life insurance is. We know there’s a lot of apathy when it comes to insurance, so were eager to ensure this campaign was one that stuck with audiences. The Last Performance is a disruptive and convention challenging campaign, using humour and integration to disrupt standard advertising in the insurance industry and encourage viewers to engage with the content.""  Lisa Fedyszyn, ECD at Special New Zealand says the campaign was an exciting one to work on: “Partners Life is always challenging industry norms and taking an innovative approach to everything they do – And their approach to advertising is no different. This is an idea that died and came back to life, about characters who die and come back to life, but it was important to find the right series to partner with. The team at South Pacific Pictures were so collaborative and inviting, and we appreciate the opportunity to jump on the back of this extremely popular show, to help New Zealanders see the importance of living with foresight rather than hindsight.""

DoorDash - Self-Love Bouquet (case study),"In 2022, DoorDash celebrated Valentine’s Day by announcing same-day flower delivery from local florists with a campaign mainly focused on awareness. But in 2023, DoorDash was already established as more than just a food delivery service. So we needed a big idea that would go one step further: sell flowers on the scale of both delivery rival Uber Eats and flower delivery giant 1-800-Flowers.  We knew that most other delivery services would cater to traditional couples. Rather than get drowned out in their conversation, we decided to start a conversation of our own by prioritizing other, less often celebrated, kinds of love.  IDEA  Though part of larger cultural conservation, self-love takes a backseat around Valentine’s Day. Since self-love isn’t new, it was important to have a fresh take. We decided to take self-love literally, tapping into the 72% of US adults that believe self-pleasuring is a form of “therapy”, and start a conversation that is weirdly taboo: female self-pleasure (Tenga, 2021).  We grounded the conversation in destigmatizing female self-pleasure using the most iconic Valentine’s gift — a bouquet of red roses. Introducing: The Self Love Bouquet, a bouquet exclusively on DoorDash made of 11 real roses and one Rose™, the best selling female sex-toy of the last five years.  In creating the bouquet, we were able to sell flowers to a new demographic – single people who don’t purchase flowers on this holiday. What could have just been a conversation about destigmatizing self-love actually put it into practice: helping women self-pleasure without shame.  STRATEGY More women than ever are spending Valentine’s Day alone (1 in 4, according to SWNS). DoorDash’s target audience for Valentine’s Day was existing consumers between 18-30 years old. With 52% of DoorDash consumers being women, we knew that we’d have to craft a narrative that gave single women permission to enjoy Valentine’s Day to the same extent that people in couples would.  This meant capitalizing on the existing narratives around pleasure, passion, and romance that are always front and center on Valentine’s Day – and tailoring them to single women. Our key message was: Be your own Valentine. Buy yourself flowers.

The Big Issue & LinkedIn - Raising Profiles (case study),"Changing perceptions of those facing poverty using the power of social media. The Big Issue is a UK street magazine which offers a new hope for homeless and vulnerably housed people. When coronavirus lockdowns hit, Big Issue vendors were unable to sell on the high streets and saw their livelihoods erased. So FCB Inferno recreated the sales model digitally on LinkedIn.

Penguin Random House  - The Portuguese (Re)Constitution (case study),"The book 'The Portuguese (Re)Constitution' is a reformulation of the Portuguese Constitution of 1933, released on April the 25th 2022, on Portugal's ""National Freedom Day'.    'The Portuguese (Re)Constitution' uses the 'blackout poetry' technique. Several poets and illustrators passed the blue pencil over this constitution until some words were highlighted, celebrating the freedom of expression. It is now part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Aljube, for Resistance and Freedom, in Lisbon.   Named 'ReConstituição Portuguesa' in Portuguese, this unprecedented book is described by its editor (Companhia das Letras, part of Penguin Random House Portugal) as “A manifesto that transforms a symbol of fascism – the blue pencil – into poetic cries of freedom.""   In the video, we are invited to go back in time, more specifically to the period between 1933 and 1974, decades in which Portugal lived under a dictatorial regime. Using the technique of blackout poetry, the design project applied the famous blue pencil (symbol of fascism) to words from the 1933 Constitution, giving rise to poems and illustrations that extol the values ​​of April.

Penguin Random House  - The Portuguese (Re)Constitution (case study),"The book 'The Portuguese (Re)Constitution' is a reformulation of the Portuguese Constitution of 1933, released on April the 25th 2022, on Portugal's ""National Freedom Day'.    'The Portuguese (Re)Constitution' uses the 'blackout poetry' technique. Several poets and illustrators passed the blue pencil over this constitution until some words were highlighted, celebrating the freedom of expression. It is now part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Aljube, for Resistance and Freedom, in Lisbon.   Named 'ReConstituição Portuguesa' in Portuguese, this unprecedented book is described by its editor (Companhia das Letras, part of Penguin Random House Portugal) as “A manifesto that transforms a symbol of fascism – the blue pencil – into poetic cries of freedom.""   In the video, we are invited to go back in time, more specifically to the period between 1933 and 1974, decades in which Portugal lived under a dictatorial regime. Using the technique of blackout poetry, the design project applied the famous blue pencil (symbol of fascism) to words from the 1933 Constitution, giving rise to poems and illustrations that extol the values ​​of April.  This work had the participation of several Portuguese authors and artists, including: Filipe Homem Fonseca, Gilson Barreto (Dela Mantra), Gisela Casimiro, DJ Huba, João Silveira, Jorgette Dumby , José Anjos, Li Alves, Lila Tiago, Lucerna do Moco, Luís Perdigão, Maria Giulia Pinheiro, Marina Ferraz, Miguel Antunes, Nilson Muniz, Nuno Piteira, Paola D’Agostino, Rita Capucho, Rita Taborda Duarte, Sérgio Coutinho.

Sheba - Hope Reef (case study),"The world’s coral reefs are dying. Mars cat food brand, Sheba, has embarked on a restoration program, an idea created in a collaboration between AMV BBDO, Mars Sustainable Solutions and the Sheba brand team. It has marked the beginning of this program by writing the word, Hope, in 35-metre high letters. The reef, off the coast of Sulawesi in Indonesia’s Spermonde Archipelago, was built using innovative structures known as Reef Stars and is a living billboard, that puts the urgency of the issue and its potential solution on the map.  The brand has promised to restore more than 185,000 square metres of coral reefs around the world by 2029. This is critically important. Scientists estimate that without interventions 90% of the world’s reefs are at risk of dying before the end of the century, perhaps even by 2043. This endangers the food supply, the protection of coasts from storms and flooding, potential new pharmaceuticals, as well as tourism and the economic health of communities that rely on it. Sheba depends on fish to produce its products. They make up the largest part of its ingredients.  The work was created by Clark Edwards, Andre Hull, Mat Scholes, Pieter Rossouw, Ricardo Porto and Victor Bustani from AMV BBDO. The installation documentary was directed by The Glue Society’s Paul Bruty and encapsulates the story of the creation of the word, Hope. The launch commercial was directed by Murray Butler through Framestore, Weare17, The Glue Society, Indo Pacific Films, Flare Production, Make Me Pulse, W3 and King Henry. Media is handled by Mediacom.  The Hope Reef “billboard” is viewable on Google Maps and Google Earth, as well as underwater in Google Street View. Reef Stars were also used as the basis of a visual identity, creating an animated growing coral typeface for use in outdoor, social and online.  In partnership with Google, Sheba has created the YouTube channel, ""Channel that Grows Coral"", with all ad revenue generated on it donated to the Nature Conservancy for coral restoration. The channel will feature an inspiring film created by AMV BBDO, which follows the engaging story of a little blue fish exploring Hope Reef. This is the first time ever that 100% of the funds from a YouTube channel have been monetised for sustainability efforts.  The full campaign by AMV BBDO has been launched in eight key markets and will run across digital, social, Google Maps, OOH, ecommerce/website launch, influencer activity, on pack and in store. Sheba has also partnered with the world’s leading visual storytellers, National Geographic, to tell the story.

Womanikin,"Conceived by JOAN’s creative collective, and supported by the United State of Women, this new product is designed as an attachment for current CPR manikins, with the intention of getting trainees accustomed to the female body and driving equality in cardiac intervention. The WoManikin was inspired by a study led by Dr. Audrey L. Blewer, an epidemiologist and resuscitation scientist with Duke University School of Medicine, which revealed that only 39% of women suffering from cardiac arrest in a public place were given CPR.  Our goal is to bridge the gap by in CPR training by normalizing a woman’s figure. So, we developed the Womankin – a universal attachment that can easily be slipped over the common flat-chested CPR manikin.   It’s time to update the education process and drive equality in cardiac intervention.

Renault - Plug Inn (case study),"By 2022, there were 1 million electric cars in France, but the infrastructure couldn’t keep up and there were only 80.000 charging stations available. That meant that driving long distances was still a problem for electric car owners, especially when driving through remote places where there were zero charging stations. This generated range anxiety and made the switch from thermic to electric more difficult. The challenge for Renault was to find a solution that would make the charging network grow fast, without having to deal with the constraints and bureaucracy of building public charging stations, while still making it available to everyone.  INSIGHT  With 1 million electric cars in the streets of France and only 80.000 charging spots available, battery range was a main concern for consumers to switch from thermic to electric vehicles. In 2020, Village Electrique thought us that people are more than willing to make the switch when they have a charging network that supports it, especially in remote locations where the charging stations amounted down to zero. By making home chargers available to everyone, we expanded the charging network to those places where it seemed impossible. People quickly engaged in being part of something that would bring a solution to electric car drivers, turning a business problem into a new business model.  IDEA Renault Plug Inn is a peer-to-peer app that connects electric car drivers to home charger owners. Drivers can find and book the home chargers available wherever and whenever they need it, and charger owners can make money by renting them out. It’s like an Airbnb for charging spots that solves the problem of driving long distances through remote places where there used to be zero charging stations for electric cars while creating a new business model.  RESULTS In only 2 weeks after it was launched, the application had 16.000 users, and had reached 107 million impressions and over 500.000€ in earned media. Plug Inn is designed to create the largest charging network in Europe by connecting electric drivers with home charger owners. The objective is to make 480.000 charging spots available in France and make electric driving possible no matter how far or how remote the destination is. In only 2 weeks after it was launched, the application had 16.000 users, and had reached 107 million impressions and over 500.000€ in earned media. In the future, this model can be expended to other countries, removing all constraints from electric driving forever. The project has been fully financed by Renault. The ambition is to expand the service to several European countries in 2024 and 2025.

The band Rudely Interrupted was promoted to dramatize how people with disabilities have many talents.,20047,our brief was to promote scope a not-for-profit organization that supports people with disabilities we began with a simple insight when people meet somebody with a disability that's often all they see but if you take the time to look beneath the surface you soon realize what they're really capable of we took an amazing group of individuals and let their talent help everyone see the person not just a disability I have a form of autism known as Asperger syndrome rock band called rudely interrupted in which five of the six members live with disabilities they showcase what we can do and we're gonna get out there and play the idea was simple we became bad promoters and launched their new song and our message to Australia we chose a poignant single from the band's album created the artwork and released it using the music industry every successful single starts with the release of a music video so we organized a well known music director to shoot one well hop constantly we wanted to get across was to see the person or not the disability so a way to realize that is to get the audience to start enjoying the songs before they can have a chance to form any kind of judgment about who's playing it we thought a way to do that is to keep the band in the dark and slowly illuminate them with tiny little spotlights and by the time any of the audience realized who's playing a song they're already into it enjoying it and on board with us and it removes the whole possibility of being judgmental and that it forces you into a different frame of mind the film clip was then screened on every Australian music channel where the band stood out amongst the usual video clip content as the video gained national PR and momentum it naturally led to commercial airplay on radio stations australia-wide you are tuned to three triple-a - welcome rudely interrupted who haven't dig tonight to launch their film clip close my eyes on iTunes people could download the track with proceeds from every sale going to scope next we advertise the national tour and promoted it through street press bill posters and online music sites the band continued to travel the country as scopes advocate spreading their message to thousands every time they take the stage they're representing every person living with a disability in Australia something scope is extremely proud to promote you

Mastercard - Where to Settle (case study),"For Mastercard, Financial Inclusion is not only the brand purpose, but business strategy. The more people have access to economic opportunity, the better for them, the world, and Mastercard. This campaign fits perfectly Mastercard’s commitment: “Doing well, by doing good”, to leverage data responsibly in the service of society. With Where to Settle project Mastercard shows efforts to help refugees from Ukraine and stabilise the lives of those who are settling in Poland.  Following the outbreak of war in Ukraine, almost 10 million refugees from occupied territories have crossed the Polish border. Poland has welcomed more Ukrainian refugees than other nations. Many Ukrainians were looking for shelter in major Polish cities that were overcrowded, causing rental hikes, increased competition for jobs — all amid an unprecedented rise in inflation. It became evident that to deal with the increasing stream of refugees, the movement had to be redirected to smaller cities.  IDEA To answer the issue, we came up with “Where to Settle” tool. The tool is based on Mastercard’s anonymized data and available data from the Polish Central Statistical Office. The unique data collected by Mastercard allowed to create a platform that reliably presents the cost of living in cities of different sizes in Poland. The tool leverages personalized data without the need to leave sensitive data on the site. By filling out a simple anonymous form, based on actual situation, location and needs, tool gives every refugee customized, condensed and crucial information. The “Where To Settle” digital platform from Mastercard aims to alleviate these challenges by showing refugees the most promising areas in Poland to make their new homes and best suit a person's abilities and needs.  STRATEGY  In the first months after the war started, as much as 34% of refugees were unable to decide where to live in Poland. It deepened their despair and made it difficult for them to become independent. Over time, the focus shifted towards looking for a place where they could feel at home. We knew that finding a place to live was fundamental, but it wasn’t everything. Another essential thing a refugee needs is a job. That brought us to the idea of creating a platform which offers real support to the refugees, helping them to find a place to live in smaller, less-known towns, and support them in finding a satisfactory job too. Moreover, the idea was to marry refugees’ needs with those of local communities – the opportunities and benefits they provide. The strategy gave us a chance to deal with concerns about refugees and their influence on communities.  EXECUTION  “Where To Settle” platform created in cooperation with Morizon-Gratka Group, part of the biggest Polish news organization providing job and apartment rental offers. The comprehensive digital tool aggregates Mastercard’s spending insights and customized data from the Polish Central Statistical Office. It asks those looking for new homes to input information such as preferred employment, family size and more. It then provides average cost of living, salary, housing and economic opportunities in various parts of the country, ultimately showing individuals and families the places where they will be most likely to thrive. The Polish government and the Association of Polish cities, the oldest Polish organization of local governments, are supporting and promoting the tool. Digital and SoMe campaign features locals from various Polish cities inviting refugees to their towns and showing them the highlights and hotspots from each area. The campaign was targeted at all Ukrainian refugees staying in major cities.  RESULTS  1. We introduced the engaging platform delivering valuable support to people in refugee crisis: We attracted 242,17k UU to the platform, and 73,7k to fill-in completed forms. Basing on data form Where to Settle and number of Ukrainian refugees in Poland, we estimate that even 20,05%* refugees benefited from the platform! 2. “Where to settle” also significantly lifted Mastercard’s perception on such important factors as “technological” +12 (UA), “modern” +14 (UA) and “social” + 14 (PL) + 11 (UA) 3. We lifted Mastercard’s ‘usage intent’ within crucial from business perspective group of “non-users”. 57% of Poles and 80% of Ukrainian declare usage intent after contact with the platform. *thanks to forms from the platform, we know that among users the average family was 4,08 persons large. It gives 300 696 persons who benefited from the platform – 20,05% of Ukrainian refugees (estimated 1,5mln).

My Special Aflac Duck,"My Special Aflac Duck®, part of Aflac’s ongoing Aflac Childhood Cancer CampaignTM and developed by Sproutel, is an innovative, smart robotic companion that features naturalistic movements, joyful play and interactive technology to help comfort children coping with cancer. With a year of child-centered research behind it, My Special Aflac Duck® is a part of Aflac’s 25-year commitment to providing care and support for children who have cancer.         Aflac’s goal is to distribute this smart companion to children in the U.S. above the age of three with cancer each year, free of charge to qualified healthcare professionals to order on behalf of patients. My Special Aflac Ducks are delivered directly to healthcare facilities. Ducks can be re-ordered as often as needed so that each and every patient has their own duck to take home to keep by their side as their compassionate companion for life. Visit AflacChildhoodCancer.org to learn more.",18428,"What if we could make a change in the lives of Children with cancer right now? I was told that I'm sorry your daughter has cancer and I was just in total shock. Everything is really new. In the beginning, I have no idea what to expect. Each year, more than 15,000 kids are diagnosed with cancer in the US. And the average length of treatment is 1000 days. And so we thought about the need for emotional comfort for these Children. And now we have the opportunity to bring the latest in Social Robotics into the field of medicine, bringing comfort and joy through this daunting process. Oh, that's awesome. What we try to do here is to give Children the tools to understand what's going on and to empower them. For our family and for why the best use would be to help him communicate in a friend to comfort him when he's having treatment. Play is natural to a child. Play is really how they learn and how they process. So we leverage play and some of the latest technology to create health care tools for kids with illness. Everybody knows the Aflac duck. We wanted to bring the AFLAC duck to life into a caring companion for Children with cancer. It responds and moves in a lifelike and natural way. They could feed their ducks, bathe their ducks. And when you tap these different cards to the ducks chest, it behaves with that feeling to help Children communicate their feelings. By the time the duck is shipping, we will have spent 18 months designing, testing and iterating with hundreds of families, doctors and experts. Where do you think the duck is doing? Singing! Duck is singing?Yes. First and foremost, the Duck is a constant companion for Children throughout their treatment journey. He's kind of cute. Candy is going to do some breathing. We're going to kind of match her breathing. Just a tiny, tiny bit faster. Perhaps most important of all, the ducks can share in the patient's experience. Natural. Yeah! What? I think it's so awesome. You just feel comfort with something like that. I really like the Aflac duck to be your friend to help you get through while you're in tough times here. I think the duck has the potential to have a huge impact on our patients, our families and our health care program as a whole. So technically you're gonna make it happen to give everybody one or something. That's the goal. If she had something to sit with her, something that can take her through it. A friend that will always be there. And that would help a lot of kids."

Corona - Corona Extra Lime (case study),"It takes two to make a thing go right and everyone knows that Corona and limes go together like fried food and heartburn. So when lime imports to China were disrupted by Covid, the AB InBev-owned beer brand partnered with local authorities to identify low-income areas in Sichuan Province where local farmers could be trained to grow limes.  Corona then sold the extra limes alongside its beers and donated the profits from the limes back to the farmers. In one year, a whopping 1 million extra limes were harvested, boosting the lime farmers’ per capita income by 21%. The campaign also racked up a respectable 943 million impressions.  This initiative speaks to a tenet of Corona’s identity – popping a lime wedge in a Corona bottleneck is an established ritual that makes the brand distinctive.

"Coinbase - Less Talk, More Bitcoin (case study)","Coinbase ran a full 60-second slot offering free Bitcoin during Super Bowl 56. The ad was so successful that it brought the crypto firm's app down. During the Super Bowl 2022, Coinbase ran a 60-second ad consisting almost entirely of a bouncing QR code. When the ""Less talk, more Bitcoin"" campaign’s code was scanned, it brought viewers to a promotional website, offering a limited time promotion of $15 worth of free Bitcoin to new sign ups, with a chance to win $3 million in a giveaway. The app stopped responding, apparently unable to handle the amount of traffic from an estimated 117 million viewers watching Super Bowl 56. Accenture Song (ex- Accenture Interactive) was the agency behind the ad.   “We believe the best way to learn about crypto is to actually try it” Coinbase CMO Kate Rouch said in a statement. “That’s why we launched our biggest giveaway ever, whereby all new customers will start their crypto journey with some Bitcoin in their account to get started. In other words: less talk, more Bitcoin.”  Coinbase spent an estimated $13 million for its minute slot. FTX, CoinGecko, and Crypto.com are all crypto exchanges estimated to have poured millions into making sure their brand gets some screen time during the Super Bowl, arguably the largest advertising event of the year.  The minimalistic commercial resulted in 20MM+ site visits during the 60sec ad, 445k+ new sign-ups, +14B media impressions, +300% brand consideration, and the Coinbase app became the 2nd most downloaded app on the App Store.

The campaign uses the tagline ""It's not happening here but it's happening now"", in various languages, from French to German. Using the transparent billboards, the campaign aims to show people what is going on in the world, even if it's not happening in front of them at the bus stop. The ads portray issues in countries like Iraq, China, and Sudan.  The campaign ""It's not happening here. But it's happening now."" shows how human rights violations take place every day, just a few hours flying time away from us.  The aim was to sensitize people in Switzerland about the issues of human rights and to stimulate debate. The poster campaign brought the truths about human rights violations around the world directly to the front doors of Swiss households. 200 posters, individually matched to fit their environment, appeared to show the collision of two worlds. For example, we see brutal scenes out of Guantanamo abruptly taking place in the middle of Zurich.

Pennies For Life - Microloan,"Case study for Microloan's Pennies For Life Campaign by DLKW Lowe. This won a Gold Cannes Lion in Mobile.   The average charity donor is unlikely to get a thank-you note that is broadcast to hundreds of people within seconds. But that's what happened to people giving money to the MicroLoan Foundation at a west London shopping centre in February. This case video shows how it was done. The messages were part of DLKW Lowe's Pennies for Life campaign for the charity, on a digital advertising billboard at Westfield Shopping Centre, which was intended to raise awareness of the charity.",16698,the microloan foundation is a charity that lends money to some of the poorest women in Africa to help them to set up their own small businesses our campaign is called pennies for life and this year we staged a unique live event we created unfinished portraits of African women made entirely of pennies and put them on a digital poster site then we invited people to complete the pictures by texting a donation to the poster as soon as the message arrived the donor got a personal thank-you then their money dropped into place on the screen the more texts we got the faster the picture built until we had enough money to make one business loan to one woman in Africa then we built another one and another one each donor also got a credit on our microsite where all the portraits were displayed it was a live interactive demonstration of small change creating big change for women in Africa and from one poster in one shopping centre in its first weekend 21 women who had nothing now have their own small businesses
The Headline News Cup Sleeve,"THE BRIEF Gulf News, the UAE's leading English daily newspaper, wanted to reach even more readers and convert them into subscribers. Our target was to gain 1.5% more subscribers, help promote their twitter channel and increase traffic to the Gulf News website by at least 25%.  THE INSIGHT AND STRATEGY Consumption habit suggests that people read newspapers while having their morning cup of coffee. Tim Hortons is one of our clients in the UAE and they serve 35-50,000 coffees per month, per outlet. Realising its untapped potential, we decided to create a campaign around them to meet our target.  THE IDEA AND EXECUTION Since fresh news goes well with fresh coffee, we adapted the coffee cup sleeve of Tim Hortons, a global coffee chain, into an advertising medium and we created The 'Headline News' Cup Sleeve.  Every cup. Every hour. Every day. When Tim Hortons customers received a cup of coffee, they also received the headline news of the hour, printed using a special printer that pulled out tweets from the Gulf News Twitter account. The short URL and QR code on the sleeve then directed them to the Gulf News website where they could read the full story.  RELEVANCE Timing is everything. So we interacted with our readers when they normally read the newspaper — when they enjoy their freshly brewed coffee. The 'Headline News' Cup Sleeve allowed us to be the first throughout the day to deliver breaking news to potential subscribers and make a meaningful connection with them.  THE RESULTS  Until now, over 1,440 headline tweets have been printed on more than 840,000 coffee cups. More than 2,900 new Gulf News Twitter followers in the first two weeks of the campaign launch. The traffic on the Gulf News website grew by 41%. Subscription's up by 2.8% so far. We're rolling out this project in Tim Hortons outlets across the UAE and in 14 new outlets soon to be opened.

Budweiser - Bring Home The Bud (case study),"Two days before the World Cup, Budweiser was banned from selling beer at stadiums in Qatar. The brand were left with thousands of liters of beer without a home. The news took the world by storm. And it seemed as though our multi-million dollar presence was a bust.   So on the first day of the tournament, Budweiser and its agency Wieden+Kennedy New York decided to give a bold answer: the brand announced that it'd give away its entire Qatar warehouse stock to the winning country for free. And we invited the entire world to #BringHomeTheBud.  Within minutes, the world took notice. Budweiser's call took over the stadiums and the streets. Budweiser became the most talked about topic before kickoff, and it only continued as fans were heard roaring chants in the stadium during the opening match: “Queremos Cerveza! (We Want Beer!)”.   It took over field boards, and spread the movement across the world through a global blitz, dropping giant red crates of Budweiser around the world. An unprecedented OOH, that would only be opened by the winning country.  And with the help of athletes, key influencers and thirsty fans, its hashtag #BringHomeTheBud has evolved into a global rallying cry for countries to root for their team to not only win the trophy, but to bring home all that extra beer.  As the World Cup continues, results keep rolling in: 4MM+ Social Mentions and 3.1B Social Reach.   With the competition at an all time high, it turned what could be the biggest sponsorship failure in history into an opportunity that brought Budweiser to a new level worldwide. An opportunity that gave a new purpose for fans to root during the World Cup all around the globe and that gave Budweiser an unprecedented place in consumers’ hearts.

"Land Transport Safety Authority – Stop (1998, New Zealand) [4K Upscale]","Gruesome anti-speeding PSA from New Zealand's very own producer of graphic road safety commercials, the Land Transport Safety Authority (who are now called the NZ Transport Agency).   Much like the TAC from their sister country Australia, the LTSA certainly didn't shy away or apologise for showing you, often in graphic detail, the true unadulterated consequences of driving like an absolute prat on the road - and that ultimately includes toe-curling descriptions alluding to child death.  The premise? Bloke speeds with his family in the car along a rural road - doesn't see another car around the bend - drives too fast that he's unable to stop in time - ends up losing control of his car - kills his beloved wife and the eldest of his two daughters from a broken neck, injuring the younger girl as well as himself. But what are a few broken bones to him when his now only daughter has lost her mother as well as her older sister? Just to make it worse, we also hear the younger daughter cry out for her dead mother at the end accompanied by a graphic close-up of the dead mother's face, covered with blood and bits of glass embedded in her skin.

MPC London | Hennessy - The Seven Worlds | Houdini Connect,"MPC London's epic visual experiment to represent the four different taste notes of Hennessy in the form of a seven minute short film, directed by Ridley Scott. In this short, they run the gamut of VFX using Houdini's tools to generate clouds, celestial scenes, flocking birds, a woodlands shapeshifting character, and more.  See the Hennessy film here: https://sidefx.co/2mQUl4K  Featuring: Selcuk Ergen - Head of FX Tushar Kewlani - FX TD Radu Ciubotariu - FX TD Marcel Ruegenberg - FX TD",15466,[Music] the whole idea about this job was basically creating a epic visual experiment to represent seven different taste notes of fantasy and the director was Ridley Scott and he decided to do this whole thing in a four minute short film each of these seven taste notes was supposed to be represented in seven different roles and they were had unique challenges and unique are Indies to them in the would grant sequence the idea is to signify the earthy tones of fantasy there's a Kalama net which is essentially in the forest this shape-shifting character he's walking through the woods and he's absorbing different elements the wood the stones all the plants get attracted to him react to him the birds are swirling almost like swirling around them in the sequence we use 2d knees for tools to groom and render the birds we've got our own custom procedural vex base together generation system since it's all procedural once we had the fully groomed beater we generate proxies and lower res assets for the crowds we were able to leverage the procedures workflow foodini to extract a model of the bird with God based feathers from the high res theater and generate multiple proxies for using in the flocking and also the variations were easy to do because it's all ramped system there's not that not much textures involved so we could generate radiations based on seed values to get different colors different schemes put a lot of assets put a lot of versions front of the client to be able to you know get approval on on the colors and then once we had them ready we could just feed that into the flocking system and since then for the crowds of birds it's just quite quite easy to do because it's all in Houdini and is all quite procedural I was tasked with creating the wood golem for the wood crunch sequence the way I've managed to accomplish the wood cruncher is by using the a mixture of bullets and grains over so we had about a million spheres being simulated and bullets and they're almost real-time which was super helpful and being able to after simulating rendering being able to go all the way back up to the route and change certain bits like if on the arm they didn't they said there's too many leaves too many twigs we could just paint paint out different assets and the way Houdini helped achieve that was by being able to manage large amount of assets really easily using packed primitives I worked on the infinite echo sequence in the project which is the last sequence and it involves basically showing the whole or the planets and the different worlds together one example of the planets we see is Greenwood crunch a planet this had to look seamless so it had to be a magic trail and in a sense where you couldn't see individual particles but rather it had to look like yeah magic the way I saw of this was a fairly classic way I did a paracin for the movement of the particles then i attracted a lot of them through this and in the end i replicated the particles with our custom tool basically our cosmo thiele bird to get the seamless look okay the floor in flames is sequence where you got a lot of clouds and basically it represents the sensation that you get when you take a soup from the earth drink this whole world was basically made of clouds so you can't really land on it you just have to flow through and we had pretty much you know only two assets on this whole sequence one being the clouds and the other is glider we rendered the whole thing in mantra but I think the main challenge was not just rendering it but basically creating the simulations of these clouds we had limited time so we had to come up with a system that is performant enough and also you know artistically friendly to do the layouts to tackle this whole challenge basically we had to create our own setup I think we were using 16.5 and sign our lead artist on the sequence did a workflow we'd open CL key leverage open CL quite a bit actually because the whole sequence had very slow-moving clouds we kind of used that to our advantage and use static clouds for a while and ask the layout artists and lighting artists to set the shots liquid statics and then it was quite easy to turn them into moving clouds afterwards once they were kind of okayed and approved we also had a procedural system that would generate proxy polygon mesh for the layout artist to basically do the layout and we would just convert them into clouds really [Music] looking at the scale of work that we've completed on his job India the different different design decisions the different design aspects the 13 and how some of it was quite you know based on quite algorithmic behaviour or like simple maths and physics and some of it was just pure design being able to work procedurally gives you confidence that the results you get in one scene can be translated across multiple scenes one of the things I'm still you know feeling good about is being able to create so many different concepts and so many different tests in a very short time there's even sequences that didn't go into the film that we actually created tons of versions so so I think that's what I'm proud of I don't think you could have done it if you didn't have access to something some of the features Houdini gives us because I think those are and extend sky's the limit you

The Swedish Postal Service  - Magical Christmas Cards,,15364,around christmas time the swedish postal service faces a problem people use digital media to tell friends about their lives the excitement of a physical letter seems to be forgotten our mission was to remind people of this and prove the strength of the traditional christmas card think about all the time and effort people spend talking about their lives on facebook could we use that to the advantage of the postal services more analog offering presenting magical christmas cards an application that collects your facebook text from the past year and transforms them into beautiful yuletide designs printed on premium paper they become real christmas cards which are delivered directly to your friends houses this is how it works you log in using your facebook account and pick a friend your mutual texts from the past year are collected from facebook the texts are used to shape a christmas card flip the card to write a greeting and use the white pages to quickly find your friend's address you can also change motifs in an instant and now you're done one click and your card is sent to the presses and the rest is taken care of by our usual suspects the funny thing is that with people spending so much time online a traditional christmas card is even more likely to gain attention because no matter how great a place like facebook is you can't put it on show in the living room until now thank you poston
Airbnb Portland Call Center.  Cannes Silver Lion Winner 2015,"Airbnb CX Hub - Portland, OR  Project Designer: Airbnb Environments Project Architect: Boora Architects   Tasked with redesigning Airbnb’s Portland office, the company’s internal Environments team sought to redefine the traditional call-center and revolutionize work.   Benefitting from Airbnb’s extensive and ongoing research on how to support and empower their Customer Experience.  Agents, the design provides a range of environments that accommodate different work styles, allowing CX Agents to choose a setting that best supports their work at any given time.   Airbnb’s Portland office now embraces the economy of sharing by embodying Airbnb’s core philosophy. We replaced the anxiety of free desking with the ability to belong anywhere.  Winner Silver Lion Branded Environments: http://www.canneslionsarchive.com/winners/entry/590505/airbnb-portland-call-center  Winner Architizer + Award for Architecture and Collaboration: http://architizer.com/projects/airbnb-portland-office/",15336,this is a call center both a model of efficiency and a denial of humanity a place where no one belongs Airbnb is commitment to a world where you can belong anywhere demands a highly specialized understanding of customer service something that can only be done in-house it was time to start taking calls where we knew there was a better way if Airbnb were to redefine the work environment the way we redefine travel we had to enter design with no assumptions and many questions what makes an office an effective and functional place to work every day the data was rich but this was the headline people wanted to work in a variety of positions in a variety of ways so we developed a new type of furniture the standing landing a standing high workspace for one can hang their jacket store their laptop and charge it overnight this is how it works the footprint of a traditional desk is subdivided providing a compact multi-use surface for the individual and giving the remaining area back to the collective in this way we can give everyone a single place to land but many places to work from here they can easily spread to adjacent areas the dining room table the living room the den power and data are everywhere meaning that one can be equally functional in any position this call center has no phones agents have comfort and freedom analogous to staying in a great Airbnb listing bringing the experience of agent and traveler closer together spaces are shared unlike in a typical suburban office where amenities are simply added until the individual's footprint becomes massive by decoupling personal space from the notion of a desk we are able to provide the same level variety but maintain the square footage per person of a typical call center this is the economy of sharing our philosophy became the diagram and the diagram became the space we replace the anxiety of free desking with the ability to belong anywhere

YUBARI City Campaign no money but love,"http://disruption.splinder.com/post/20909743/Yubari%2C+no+money+but+love  With a debt of $353 million, Yubari City in Hokkaido, Japan, went bankrupt in 2007. Our mission was to promote Yubari, reenergize its citizens, and help make the city economically viable once more.  We focused on the fact that Yubari boasted the lowest divorce rate in the whole of Japan and created the idea, ""Yubari, no money but love"". In expanding this idea we created a loveable, yet slightly ironic character called ""Yubari Fusai"" - Fusai means both debt and married couple in Japanese. We then collaborated with the City to create additional schemes that positioned the city as a destination for happy couples  official certificates of happily married couples, branded merchandise and Yubari music CDs, to name but a few.    $1.5 million was generated in advertising value with exposure including 100 newspaper mentions, 100 online media mentions, 30 TV mentions and 53,100 blog entries (source: Google search). -Since the initiation of this project, annual number of visitors to Yubari increased 10% year on year, whilst $31 million has been generated toward alleviating the city's debt. - Branded Yubari Fusai products that initially were only available in Yubari now enjoy popularity nationwide.

MTV NETWORKS AUSTRALIA 'WELCOME SNOOP' CAMPAIGN,A seven minute case study of the integrated 'Welcome Snoop' campaign for MTV Networks Australia.     Dejan Rasic at Lowe Hunt.,11986,I came out to Australia with the help of MTV to try to become a citizen a good citizen of Australia and when I came out there I had a great time I mixed it up with the people on the beach had studio time when got me a little spot I was gonna move in everything was lovely w did what I'm saying then all of a sudden I get ready to come back and the government said I can't get here how about that but the people out there in Australia had no Snoop Dogg they know who I am and how I am continue to fight for me because they got to let me in I'd already put a down payment down on my house out there so MTV big Snoop Dogg journey with me as I become a citizen of the land down under this MTV brand campaign started with a brief to give MTV Networks Australia the personality relevant to its local audience in answer to that challenge the creative strategy was developed to put a controversial MTV icon into the Australian culture and stir the pot the icon was infamous gangster rapper Snoop Dogg and the creative idea would be his fight for Australian citizenship throughout production the reason for snoops Australian visit remain top secret which instantly attracted a hive of media attention both in Australia and abroad Snoop Dogg being on board with the concept used every opportunity to see the idea during phase 1 of the campaign including an announcement to thousands of fans during his live performance at the Sydney good vibes music pistol phase two of the campaign took place around the MTV Australia Video Music Awards when the Australian Immigration Minister denied Snoop Dogg an entry visa to host the show referring to snoop as being not the sort of bloke we want in Australia this is a man who is a member of a gang in Los Angeles implicated in murder and robberies and the drug trade he doesn't seem the type of person that we want as a role model in Australia even the Prime Minister commented on the issue snoops absence became the biggest news story in Australia drawing national and international attention to the Australian arm of MTV through a wide variety of media organizers of the MTV Music Awards a hopeful us rapper Snoop Dogg will still perform on Sunday night rap singer Snoop Dogg has been banned from entering Australia for this weekend's Video Music Awards the campaign idea of course accounted for smooth being denied entry back into the country after weapons and drugs charges and in the lead-up to the event MTV Australia managing director David Sibley appeared on national television saying that MTV still remains optimistic about getting snoop to the event good morning well first of all we're disappointed and in fact the most disappointed person is snoop he's absolutely gutted he had his bags packed and he's ready to go he doesn't love coming here but ultimately we're optimistic the process does allow us to provide more information which we did last night so we're hopeful but on Sunday at 8 p.m. when we run our show Snoop will be part of it the big question soon became would Smoot make it or wouldn't he as the stars arrived pledging their support for Snoop no one was sure what would happen we would like to take this time to just thank your wonderful Immigration Minister for being such a huge supporter of the AVMA and when snoop was announced as the winner of best hip hop video the audience was shocked to see Snoop Dogg celebrating his win on a yacht in Sydney Harbour I want to thank you off with the award that I've won for the second year in a row appreciate that you'll be seeing a whole lot more of me in your town so spread the word cuz big Snoop Dogg is in the land down under I come from the land down and the crowd was ecstatic the acceptance speech shot three months before was the cause of many more days of media speculation around the immigration issue at the end of snoop speech a URL appeared on screen directing people to a website where they could vote for Snoop Dogg posters were also plastered throughout the MTV Music Video Awards after-party with the same message and within days snoops fight the citizenship had spread across Australia and overseas myspace and MTV websites directing people to the petition were launched during this second phase local radio personalities even publicized the petition on popular Sydney radio programs attempts will be made in court today to overturn cameras decision to ban Snoop Dogg from Australia MTV has got 24 hours to convince the government to let Snoop Dogg into the country mr. dog has been banned from entering Australia this move was to return to appear on the MTV Awards on Sunday the third and final phase of the campaign was then launched with a topical 11 minute documentary running on TV and over the Internet covering everything from swoops visa issues through to mixing the Australian culture with LA gangster values this was also distributed through 16 short films so snap now if you're going to live in Australia I think it's about time you learned about the national game we're missing one and one bit here the box that's what this right here that means oh that's too little I leave this the big ball protector that jungle don't do it they told me to be a good Australian I have to learn about Australian values but some stuff is not that different we have that's where I come from this way but we don't hit balls we hit [ __ ] and they love a [ __ ] head nobody's got a bit of car but that's what Australia celebrates the difference between all of us come on give me another I'm taking this [ __ ] for what I get up with [ __ ] do I get to [ __ ] him up with this little older bang bang that goes with it I mean this is what mr. dog is about the documentary was further supported by extensive print and poster campaigns directing people to the petition website and the whole of phase 3 is underpinned by a heartfelt plea from Snoop Dogg himself to join the good fight with four hundred and ten thousand five hundred and ninety three online viewers alone which equates to sixteen point nine percent of the target market in Australia and a total of five and a half million campaign interactions the welcome snoop idea created a hive of media attention around MTV Australia activating a movement among the target audience to help MTV fight snoop scores why you dissing on my main man the dog the dog need to represent in Australia's hood yeah the campaign has proven incredibly successful attracting over three times more NTV subscribers from the previous year and elevating MTV Australia brand awareness to its highest point in history and if enough votes are registered Smith may still become a legitimate Australian citizen

'Unbox Me' and let me tell you who I am,"In the lead up to the International Transgender Day of Visibility on March 31st, UNAIDS has launched an initiative aimed at raising awareness regarding the rights of transgender children.  All children love to create hidden places where they can hide their precious trinkets or prized possessions safely and securely. These hidden objects can reveal a lot about the child – who he/she is, what he/she likes and what his/her dreams are. For some transgender children, this act of hiding treasures becomes a way of hiding their identity from disapproving eyes. ‘Unbox Me’ is an effort to symbolically unbox their secret to the world and open the conversation for so many transgender children out there, not just in India, but everywhere.  This is part of a year long collaboration with FCB India and the #SeeMeAsIAm campaign. Transgender people around the world are often marginalized and experience discrimination and violence. As a result, transgender people are at a heightened risk of HIV – up to 13% higher than the global population. In addition, up to 24 countries in the world criminalize or prosecute transgender people. 'Unbox Me' is about countering such stigma and discrimination.",10695,[Music] [Music] foreign [Music] as a kid i did not understand what this trans person is i always felt i'm a woman but i was not allowed to share it with anyone else [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] kumar this is lakshman's box a razor a nail polish a lovely bracelet and we also have a little note i like to look in the mirror when no one else is looking let's look at children in the way that they look at themselves let no child have to hide from the world [Music]
H&M - Karl Lagerfeld (2004),"Fabulous black and white commercial from H&M.  In November 2004, Lagerfeld launched a collection with this fast-fashion retailer. These items, which included T-shirts with Lagerfeld’s face cartooned onto them ($19.90) and a sleek sequin jacket ($129), cost a fraction of the price of his previous designs and were sold at stores across Europe and the US. It sold out almost instantly.  “We’ve been operating this business for some 60 years and we’ve never seen anything like it,” Jörgen Andersson, who was H&M’s marketing director at the time. “We are as surprised as the customer.”  Lagerfeld, however, accused the retailer of “snobbery”: “It was great to work with the people at H&M as we all helped each other to make it a success. But the incomprehensible decisions of the management in Stockholm have taken away any desire to do it again. They did not make the clothes in sufficient quantities. I find it embarrassing that H&M let down so many people… I don’t think that is very kind, especially for people in small towns and countries in eastern Europe. It is snobbery created by anti-snobbery.”  Since its first designer collaboration with Lagerfeld, H&M has partnered with a host of high-end labels including Versace, Balmain, and Stella McCartney.

Introducing The Illegal Blood Bank,"Blood is going to waste each year because of an outdated policy, which says that gay or bisexual men can only donate as long as they abstain from sex for three months.  Working alongside Freedom To Donate, UNILAD is campaigning for the UK Government to remove the three-month deferral period and to introduce a new individualised risk assessment that will assess someone’s sexual behaviour, not their sexual orientation.  We’re opening the Illegal Blood Bank: the first blood bank where gay & bisexual men can donate their blood in protest. It will open on November 23, 2019, at a secret location in London. Qualified medical professionals will take and test the blood and help show how effective individualised risk assessment could be at introducing new, safe blood donors into the system.   With a 25% drop in men donating blood over the past five years and a 6% drop in women, the NHS requires 135,000 new donors each year to meet demand.

THE COSMOPOLITAN DIGITAL EXPERIENCE,"Win Cannes Lions 2011 - Design ( Grand Prix ) Advertising Agency: DIGITAL KITCHEN Chicago, USA  Brief Explanation: Las Vegas was once the city of sin. Now it has become a city of clichés. Hotels have relied on gimmicks and themes to distinguish themselves, creating a cluttered marketplace. The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas is committed to building a platform for fresh and provocative content that sits at the intersection of art and technology. Throughout the resort are multiple points for customers to experience digital artwork including more than 500 displays of different shapes, sizes and resolutions built into the architecture. Our challenge: create an immersive experience for hotel guests that set The Cosmopolitan apart on the strip.  Describe the brief from the client: The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas is a $3.9 billion dollar resort, casino and hotel located on the center of the strip. When the Cosmopolitan Hotel planned to open its doors on New Year's Eve 2010, they set out to create a more meaningful guest experience for a different class of traveller. Our assignment was to help The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas position itself as a luxury destination, adding an entirely new dimension to the Las Vegas experience.  Description of how you arrived at the final design: Digital Kitchen approached the portals as digital canvases and the entire resort as a curated art gallery. We invented a narrative showcase incorporating elegant, fantastical, and often poetic interpretations of life travels in an enlightened, lucid dream, blurring the lines of past present and future into one classic-timeless visual style. The narrative spoke directly to our target audience, the Creative Class, 59 million Americans who are open minded and enjoy adventure.

Iberdrola - Turnstile Turbines (case study),"Europe is going through an unprecedented energy crisis. Governments are asking people to make efforts at all levels to avoid power cuts. Crisis are always an opportunity to rethink and improve existing things. Iberdrola, the European leading wind energy provider decided to show people that energy sources exist everywhere.   We call it wasted energy: it can be the wind or anything that generates a force like the 1.7 billion people taking the subway every year in Paris. We decided to reinvent the turnstile they cross every day to replace it with the world first underground wind turbines: the Turnstile Turbines.   To create the prototypes, we partnered with 14 students from one of the biggest French engineering schools, Junia HEI. Working hand in hand with Iberdrola engineers, they created a functional prototype that generates energy with each pass. The mechanism is directly inspired by real wind turbines system and automatic watch. The design was thought to remind people of wind turbines, to make people immediately understand the new purpose of the object.   The prototypes were installed in the subway station Miromesnil, in the heart of Paris, generating more than 2 200 watts per day. Deployed across the Paris underground, the Turnstile Turbines system could generate enough energy to power an entire line and save more than 30,000 tons of CO2 per year. The prototypes will be soon installed in the Madrid subway.   The project drew the attention of media, generating more than 130M impressions and appearing in the headline of the 3 most important French newspapers. It was also commented by a committed senator and massively shared on social media.

Clarks Shoes - Foot Drawing - CDP 1978,Directors: Mike Seresin and Neil Godfrey. Creative team: Tony Brignull and Neil Godfrey,7612,this little foot will get corns and bunions if a shoe is too tight across here so clarks make a range that covers four different widths and if a shoe only fits up to here the foot can slide forwards and stop the toes so clarks always fit up to here and if the backs only come up this far your child could develop claw toes trying to keep the shoe on so all clark's shoes cradle the heel completely and of course we always make sure there's up to three months growing room in every pair this is our blueprint these are our shoes

See Stress Differently – Behind The Scenes - Global IPMI,"We are all affected by stress in some way. But it’s hard to take control of something we can’t see.  Cigna has partnered with Digital Artist Sean Sullivan to make the invisible visible for the first time.  The result? The first visualization of stress in the body and mind. Cool colors and turbulence suggest higher stress levels. Hot colors and turbulence suggest higher stress levels. Showing that stress doesn’t just affect you emotionally, it affects you physically, too.  Find out more about how to take control of stress using Cigna’s tools at https://bit.ly/2lVfASk",7090,[Music] this is such a fascinating project because when has anyone seen stress before I think we've all experienced stress but I don't think we've ever really seen it so I think this was a great opportunity to explore what stress might look like when we don't manage stress what can start out as episodic becomes more chronic in nature and in those cases can overwhelm us and lead to several chronic diseases well it's very easy for people to think of it just as an emotional issue but there are some very real physical signs and so that's why we wanted to help people visualize that [Music] visualising stress in the body is something that's completely new so we had to choreograph a whole new piece of technology we wanted to work in real time so that we could show people what effect stress was having on their bodies right there and then we're using a few different devices one is something that monitors brainwaves it's like a headband and with that we can actually detect the alpha waves and the beta waves in the brain which are associated with a state of relaxation or a state of stress respectively we are using a heart rate sensor we know that people's heart rates are elevated when they are more stressed finally we have a device that monitors perspiration or sweat which gives us some indication as well so we're using really those three different components and then putting them all together in one visualization big question was what distress in the body look like we needed to give it an arresting but beautiful look in the initial phases we were doing a lot of sketching looking at a lot of reference of medical data of heat maps I think we kind of agreed it was this thing that we all wanted to get under control so we started think a lot about things that that have different states of controllers like water or smoke like fluid thing and water can be calm but it could also be turbulent or intense at the same time we created a unique algorithm that could read the inputs from each medical device and output them in real-time in this visual style so the colors are essentially a sequential heat map from low stress to high stress where blue and green would represent low stress and then purple and orange yellow would be high stress in a higher stress individual you'd see a lot more turbulence a lot more of these sort of flares kind of coming off and a lot more of a shape and distorted figure and the glowing effect is the galvanic skin response so if an individual has high conductance and it'll set off the least sort of fire flight and it's parks across the figure once you see stress differently and can see how it really affects your mind and your body then you can make a plan to take control [Music] you [Music]

Hermann Vaske's Ad for Hornbach Silicate Paint,"Blixa Bargeld reads Hornbach is an extraordinary yet relevant campaign for Hornbach superstore.    In a series of 13 spots Bargeld, founder and singer of the cult band ""Einstürzende Neubauten"", reads the Hornbach catalogue, juxtaposing low art and high art in Ernst Jandl style.     The winds of avant-garde blow through the Hornbach catalogue when Blixa Bargeld shouts ""Bohrlochschwämme"", and ""Silikatfarbe"" and ""Quarzitpolygonalplatten"".     Blixa Bargeld, who is known for his collaboration with theatre legend Heiner Müller on  ""Hamletmaschine"" as well as for his extraordinary stage acts with ""Einstürzende Neubauten"", delivers a breathtaking performance in his readings -- authentic, powerful, sensitive and ironic at the same time. ""Blixa Bargeld turns the banal of the small print into a piece of art"", says Paul Arden from ASD Lionheart.    The films were conceptualized by Heimat Berlin and directed by Hermann Vaske, who also produced the spots. They were shot on Super 8 on location in Cannes, including an old aviation control station, an old harbour mole, a former hotel and an underground car park. ""Blixa Bargeld reads Hornbach"" is the discovery of beauty in unexpected places.    Everyday culture is celebrated and day-to-day art business ridiculed. ""Sometimes you can only see the truth when you turn things upside down"", says Blixa Bargeld. ""To read the Hornbach catalogue wasn't my idea, but I liked the idea and that is why I did it. If I hadn't treated texts in this way this before, I wouldn't have been able to see that it's possible.""    „I was fascinated by the project because it fulfilled my definition of creativity: to bring two things together that have nothing to do with each other, to form a third,"" says director Hermann Vaske who collaborated before with Bargeld on a commercial for the Erotic Art Museum in Hamburg.    The films were shown on VIVA Music Television in conjunction with a Bargeld special.

Guaraná Antarctica - Stuck In The 80's (Case Study),Agency: SOKO.CX Director: Talita Menezes (CLAVA),5652,hey are you aware that the investment made in women's soccer today is the same what men received in the 80s remember the men's fine only 92 it had a 20 million dollar prize which is exactly the same value for the women's final in 2019 it's like our girls were stuck in the 80s puerto antarctic is a major soda brand in brazil an official sponsor of women's soccer since forever so we decided to go to the biggest sporting event in the world to draw attention to the matter asking for approval of the bill that fights for equal prize money for men and women in sports in the country [Music] minor detail the olympics are globally sponsored by our main richer almighty competitor so we asked the national women's soccer league players a little favor and they arrived in tokyo carrying gadgets from the 80s stuck in the 80s movement which quickly was all over press and even became the official theme of the biggest and most prestigious soccer awards in brazil hosted by espn but if we wanted to change the law we had to make a whole country understand what it means to be stuck in the 80s so we relaunched our classic 80s bottle for real making the conversation become not only a stunt but a constant reminder of the girls reality for our more than 35 million monthly consumers looking for guarana on the shelves of course a hundred percent of his sales proceeds went to help correct the prize money gap by directly supporting women's soccer in brazil back to the future remember the bill we wanted to proved well it passed congress it sounds like the 80s will be finally behind us
Raid - Certified Care (case study),"In partnership with the Society for Family Health-Rwanda, Raid launched 'Certified Care' - a vocational program officially certifying women as Community Healthcare Workers and finally giving them a way to earn a living wage for something they've spent a lifetime doing for free: caring for those with malaria.   Raid turned women's unofficial and unpaid roles as caregivers into official, paid positions so that they can build the future the deserve tor themselves and their families.   World Malaria Day happens every year on April 25th. It may not be a disease that’s particularly top of mind for us living in the United States, but in the country of Rwanda it’s a daily struggle. This serious and sometimes fatal illness is caused by a parasite that commonly infects a certain type of mosquito which feeds on humans. People who get malaria are typically very sick with high fevers, shaking chills, and flu-like symptoms.  But the effects of malaria go well beyond the bite—Rwandan women are disproportionately affected by the disease because they are the unofficial caregivers for the sick in their families and communities, typically removing them from school or work, which limits their ability to earn a living wage. People in the community have a strong reliance on these women, known locally as community health workers. In fact, 55 percent of all the malaria cases are handled by them, making them heroes of their communities.  In an effort to provide protection for everyone, SC Johnson, along with one of its leading insect control brand teams, Raid®, is empowering these women with official certifications for what they already know how to do—care. In partnership with the Society for Family Health Rwanda and Rwanda Ministry of Health, SC Johnson with its Raid® team has formed the Certified Care program as part of its commitment to help eradicate malaria. In fact, SC Johnson has been using its expertise and capabilities to make contributions toward eradicating malaria and helping make life healthier and better for families in countries across Africa for decades.  This Certified Care program converts the time and experience these community workers have accumulated caring for others into a real certification to become certified Community Health Workers. This will provide them with the education and certification they need to earn a living wage and be paid for what they were already doing.  So far, the program has certified 10,000 Community Health Workers to help fight malaria, and hopes to continue to grow until malaria is no longer. Help honor the courageous women working on the front lines and amplify the importance of the fight against malaria by sharing this message, not just on World Malaria Day, but every day.

"Transport Accident Commission – Beach Road (1990, Australia) [4K Upscale]","Probably one of the most heart-wrenching TAC ads, if not road safety PSAs of all time.  This was, I think, TAC's second-ever commercial that they produced after their first debut with 'Girlfriend' a few months prior in December 1989. This one aired along with a spot titled 'Speed Cameras' on the exact same date (04/04/90), which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hdekam-qNk – a slightly more pre-watershed-friendly version that used a similar sort of lingo. Much like 'Girlfriend' introduced their infamous ""If you drink, then drive, you're a bloody idiot"" tagline, this one also introduced one of TAC's most memorable quotes that they would subsequently use for a good few years after that: ""Don't fool yourself, speed kills.""  In this one, we see an ambulance crew desperately trying to resuscitate a young boy who has been hit by a speeding driver, who is concurrently being questioned by a police officer. Unfortunately, the boy remains completely unresponsive to medical resuscitation – at this time we see the young boy's distraught mother rushing onto the scene, screaming her disbelief at the medics tragically making the decision to cease resus. The officer then relays the information to the driver that the young boy has died, as one of the Ambulance Officers reflects upon how the driver now has to live with that for the rest of his life – bitterly scolding us for one final time that speed kills. We end with the boy's mother sobbing inconsolably, wailing like a banshee (presumably for God or some other higher power) to bring back her boy as the driver hangs his head in ineffable shame. Perhaps he's called Dave as well.   Gritty and uncompromising, with absolutely no attempt to whitewash the stark reality and brutality of fatal road accidents caused by careless driving. Good old TAC.   For anyone who's curious, an interesting evaluation report of TAC's earlier TV ads courtesy of Monash University can be found here: https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/216514/muarc052.pdf    Directed by Peter Schmidt at Grey Melbourne.

Vow - Mammoth Meatball (case study),"Prehistoric meat doesn’t sound all that appetising, but it certainly is attention-grabbing. And that’s why Australian cultured meat startup Vow decided to turn the mammoth into a meatball. This audacious PR campaign pushes the boundaries of what is scientifically possible, exactly the type of limit-testing creativity that deserves to be celebrated.   To cook up the meatball, scientists recreated the DNA of the extinct creature, filling any gaps with fragments of DNA from the African elephant. This proved how Vow’s products (grown from the cells of animals) are wildly different from plant-based meat alternatives like Impossible or Beyond Meat (a common misconception). While people couldn’t sample the Mammoth Meatball (for fear of uh, death), it acted as a product demo by concretising a complex scientific process.  ""Very few consumers know what cultured meat actually is"" said James Ryall, Vow’s chief scientific officer. ""Getting a story about cultured meat into mainstream media is difficult, so we knew we needed to do something outrageous.""  According to the agency, it worked. The story was picked up by 3,400 outlets, allowing Vow’s rallying cry, ""Let’s eat ourselves out of extinction"", to echo across the world.

fanta stealth sound,fanta stealth sound campaign,3365,Fanta believe teens should have the right to play this idea was inspired by the controversial ultrasonic alarms used to disperse teenage groups these play high-pitch sounds which only young people can hear when you get older you can't hear these sounds anymore as your hearing naturally gets worse morning first our main story for you this morning the Sonic device known as the mosquito used to stop teenagers Gathering their public plac cases should be banned that's according to England's children's commissioner the mosquito it's called emits a high pitched noise which manufacturers claim can only be heard by those under 25 critics say it's an ineffective way of tackling antisocial behavior and that it demonizes young people we turned this technology on its head the mobile application we invented the Fanta stealth sound system enables the same teenagers to communicate between themselves using these high pitch frequencies which adults cannot hear it's a scientific fact that as you get older your hearing gets worse you can't hear high pitch frequencies anymore this is a teenager his hearing is perfect he can hear the high pitch frequencies in the Fanta stealth sound system which means he can communicate with friends in secret and I can't hear a thing the application has already generated considerable media interest directions to the website is on over 50 million packs in Great Britain the viral film has been seeded to over 4 million teenagers across Europe so what is the stealth sound system the stealth sound system uses sound waves that most adults can't hear most adult ears are damaged due to overexposure to loud things such as domestic rows and popular music to make it work go to the WAP site and download it straight to your mobile phone then adjust the volume on your phone keep doing this until you can hear it but older people can't by using the uncool sound you can say something is uncool or use the cool sound if you think something is cool the warning sound should only be used in serious circumstances like if a huge flaming meteorite is seconds from the earth and finally there's the wolf whistle sound the wolf whistle is an ancient and very effective form of communication which has been around since the 1970s use it to tell your best mate you Fancy's mother we have also broadcast the world's first silent radio ad in UK shopping malls only teenag were able to hear the stealth sounds in the gaps so only they could hear its full message this is an advertisement for the Fanta stealth sound system you can use the sounds when you find someone really or when you need to from somewhere or when you think something is very very so pick up a can of fanta to find out how to download all these sounds from the website but do it soon cuz to be honest by the time you get to my age you won't hear a thing which is we felt this is a perfect way of engaging with our core Target group of of teenagers in a a way that we haven't done before so I mean it's the one thing to to put out a TV at that is that is nice and it's another thing to actually put out something that consumers are excited about and that they use every day uh amongst their their peers so it helped us to become part of uh a community and the communities is are teenagers so it's it's brilli brilliant it's a perfect tool to you know that represents what Fanta stands for to overcome you know adulthood and boredom that is part of that and give give our CAG group a way to communicate with each other uh without the rest of the world knowing so I mean how cool is that I personally like just the the the facial expressions of people who can hear it versus those who cannot hear it and if you put both together in one room it's amazing the reactions that you see as a demonstration and just in case you don't understand the idea fully we have been playing the stealth sounds all the way through this film so those of you around the age of 16 would have heard the sounds loud and clear and those over a certain age would have heard absolutely nothing at all

The Tempest & Intel | London | Royal Shakespeare Company,The RSC is working with Intel and The Imaginarium Studios to reimagine Shakespeare’s The Tempest for the 21st Century. Glimpse behind the scenes and discover how modern technology is being used to bring to life Shakespeare’s magical island land and characters.  The Tempest will transfer to the Barbican in London from 30 June - 18 August.  www.rsc.org.uk/tempest,3272,"The Tempest is the most magical ofShakespeare's plays. I wanted particularly for Shakespeare'sgreat 400th jubilee, to do something special. What's 21st century magic? Well, I guess it comes in some kind of digital form these days.   We started to see a lot more in film, inthe world of movies, but we never really explored that in the theatre context, andthat's where Intel came in. With The Tempest we're really trying to redefine theatre in some respect, and find a way to bring in new digital technology and really leverage it to make the story deeper, to find new ways to connect witha character and maybe a different audience.   It's the creative process drives thetechnology, rather than the other way around.   A match made in heavenfrom that point of view. I think that there's a set of reallycompelling characters that are 400 years old, that I want to see Greg and Stephenbring to life for an entirely new generation.   The most exciting thing about whatwe're doing at the moment is enabling an actor to have a real connection with anavatar. It's the sort of thing that I do on adaily basis in the studio for films and for video games. In this instance, we're doingsomething that's going to be a live theatrical experience. What you see is what you get. The play demands a spectacle. There's as a masque in the middle of the play, and insubstantialpageant which fades into nothing, but it creates wonder.   I want to let the guys at Intel know a bitabout what that tradition was, just how elaborate those masques were, and how they were pushing the envelope. I don't think an audience coming to seeThe Tempest in 2016 will ever have seen anything quite like it, and that's what we're trying to do, we'retrying to find moments when that most magical of Shakespeare's plays cancreate a new and a very special kind of wonder. So watch this space."

Descripcion: The objective was to communicate the weekly specials through TV in the midst of a financial crisis that had commerces maximizing their budgets while cutting down on expenses. This stirred a retail advertising war that ended up creating a huge amount of bumper commercials that were nothing less than boring and monotonous. The target audience was housewives, stay-home mothers and any other character that had the power to choose which household items were getting purchased. We knew we had to find a more entertaining and interesting way of communicating the specials in a more relevant way. The client advertised the articles in its inventory and the target audience got the information with an emotional load. While some overlays were completely rational others had a hint of humor that stuck with the target audience in a moment of complete attention. A superimposed banner that reacted through funny messages within the context of the actions and the article that was being promoted. Using a unique media negotiation with the channels that broadcasted the 5 top rated soap operas we were able to insert a breakthrough way of announcing the week%u2019s offers: a superimposed banner. A week prior to the air date all the soap opera%u2019s episodes were evaluated and studied, looking for articles that looked like the ones in the offer for the upcoming week. During the broadcast, at any given moment the banners reacted through funny messages within the context of the actions and the article that was being promoted",2692,the 2008 financial crisis has had a strong impact in Dominican retailers forcing businesses to cut down expenses and maximize budgets making more emphasis in the offers than in branding advertising which is why a retail advertising War started taking place throughout all media including radio press inserts and TV the highest populated medium in the country where bumper commercials were used the most to communicate the offers the result was so boring and monotonous that it inevitably induced zapping we wanted to find a more entertaining and interesting way to communicate the weekly specials through TV using a unique media negotiation with the channels that broadcasted the five top-rated soap operas we were able to insert a breakthrough way of announcing the week's offers a superimposed banner a week prior to the air date all the soap operas episodes were evaluated and studied looking for articles that look like the ones in the offer for the upcoming week during the broadcast at any given moment the banners reacted through funny messages within the context of the actions and the article that was being promoted furthermore the messages in the banners reflected the personality of the characters in the soap opera for example this character was the seductive one most of the times you'd find her in her underwear and this guy he was one of the bad ones a Bonafide mob man throughout the season this character changed her hair color twice the previous scene was a really hard day at work in this scene he wants to seduce the other person into getting what she wants this is the soap opera hottie the one everyone drools over and this one was just the personification of evil more than 200 banners were made with a race that reached the national Spectrum receiving a lot of free press in the ranking of most admired companies compelled in 2008 La Sirena rose with 50.9 percent another study showed the buying preference and its rise to 42.5 percent and a closing in the year with a share of voice of 76 percent because

Flock Associates - Musée de la Grande Guerre du Pays de Meaux: Facebook 1914 Campaign by DDB Paris,"http://www.flock-associates.com  Imagine if Facebook existed 100 years ago?  That's what DDB Paris, France asked when they created this touching campaign for Musée de la Grande Guerre du Pays de Meaux.  The Museum of Great War opened in Meaux in 2011.  To help with their promotion, DDB decided they needed to re-invoke the memory of World War I whilst also enticing a younger audience to visit war museums.  Thus, Facebook 1914 was made.  A fictional Facebook profile was created for Leon Vivien, an average French man who was called to duty during World War I and torn away from his wife and baby.  This campaign allowed people to follow and invest in Leon's story.  Illustrations from the museum's collections were also used along with printed invitations to the opening.  Facebook 1914 earned plenty of media coverage without spending much money and gained many followers wondering how Leon's story would end, making it a very successful integrated campaign.  Facebook 1914 was shortlisted for the Titanium and Integrated Lions Award at the Cannes Lions Awards in 2013.    Flock would like to thank Ursula Pola for recommending this poignant video.  http://www.flock-associates.com",2191,"Facebook 24 million members in France posting day after day all the details of their peaceful lives now imagine if Facebook had existed a century ago more than a brand page a personal profile introducing Leon Vivian a 29-year-old ordinary man a school teacher who is Exempted from service in August 1914 his best friend is suddenly sent to war and killed in October Leon is finally drafted and torn away from his pregnant wife meline 5 months of military training from Life in the barracks to outdoor Maneuvers before being sent to the front in April 195 it's been announced tomorrow we're going to the front you could share Leon's thoughts I can't help thinking about the people who lived here children were born here their cries filled the house their laughter echoed and no one will climb that staircase again to comfort them at the end of the day you could share his little moments of joy and the constant fear of his daily nightmare our Horizon corpses and mud a viscous mud so cold that the living through so much trembling almost Envy the dead hundreds of posts 10 characters one destiny all with the same question in mind will Leon see his family again one year of History told as a human story richly illustrated by the Museum's collection 10 months of posts uploaded for the launch plus 2 months of live posts every day €3 million EUR of earned media all for the cost of 400 printed invitations to the press conference €250 50,000 followers within the first 2 weeks thousands of comments hundreds of questions answered by the museum at the end people were invited to learn more about the millions of lons and melins who endured World War I by visiting the museum the number of visitors on location increased by 45% the page was relayed by the national board of education more than an ad campaign a way to bring awareness to Young [Music] Generations"

GOOGLE VOICE SEARCH,"GOOGLE VOICE SEARCH  GOOGLE  GOOGLE VOICE SEARCH  MANNING GOTTLIEB OMD London, UNITED KINGDOM  Results and Effectiveness The results proved the attention to detail paid off: Campaign recognition was over three times the outdoor average. The campaign became a topic of conversation: more than a quarter of people surveyed said they actively spoke to someone about the campaign. But most importantly people changed their behaviour as a result: Google searches for ""voice search"" in London more than doubled versus the rest of the country -- the biggest proportion coming from smart phones - ensuring Google hit their launch targets for this product.   Creative Execution By taking a key strength of digital -- hyper relevant context - and marrying it with the scale and ubiquity of outdoor we did something that had never been done before: a broadcast outdoor campaign where every creative execution was relevant to the poster site that it ran on. We zoomed in on every available individual poster site in London, and using Google maps plotted the interesting institutions in the immediate environs. The resultant database became the creative brief. As such, the precise media context explicitly informed the creative execution. Posters in the Square Mile ran ""foot-see wun-hun-dred"". Sites outside stadia carried ""ley-tist skohrz"". Sites at Baker Street carried ""Shur-lok Hoemz"" Difficult to pronounce stations carried the phonetic spelling as the copy ...in total 150 pieces of bespoke pieces of copy across ten different poster formats, amounting to the most complex outdoor campaign ever in the UK.   Insights, Strategy and the Idea Google asked us to plan the ATL launch of their new 'voice search' smart phone technology. The core insight lay within a contradiction: Google is the most omnipresent and everyday brand but it is perceived as being a little cold and distant. We needed to show some wit and warmth in the brand, while getting people to do something different as a result of the advertising. The advertising agency (BBH) were playing with the creative thought of using phonetics to bring the voice search product benefit to life. Our pivotal contribution was to build on this by making every piece of copy relevant to the context in which it was consumed.

After the project IR magazine raised the topic and because of our experiment state police admitted that there is something wrong with the laws, so now they are working on a new and hopefully better law.",1227,"latvia is a country of magic every spring countless bike spanish from the sweets of riga never to be seen again we had to solve this mystery first we wanted to find the most popular spots where bikes disappear we launched a map and asked people to share places where their bikes have vanished in a few days we got a map full with locations we than equipped five bikes with GPS transmitters put them in the five most popular spots and film them on livestream cameras to catch the moment we asked people to monitor the GPS trackers and watch live stream videos of bikes on our webpage and guess what on the very first day a miracle happened our followers tweeted the one of the bikes had started to move thanks to the GPS transmitter we were able to follow the bike and catch magician Paulo who's been practicing this bike ceiling magic for some time then a miracle happened again because of latvian state laws police had to let bothell go despite more than 16,000 crime witnesses online after the experiment ed magazine raised the topic with support from witnesses the state government was forced to recognize the problem so now they are working on a new and hopefully better lock abracadabra"

The Green Light Signal - National Grid,"Along with Edelman, we worked with National Grid to make clean energy visible.  Through a technology hack, the studio developed a system that empowered people to be more aware of how the power they use is generated and when to use it.  By creating an easy-to-use smart bulb and app system, we could track when places in the UK were running on green energy sources. When an optimal time hit, where energy was mainly supplied from low-carbon sources, such as wind or solar - the light would turn green, indicating to users a time to turn on their applications or charge their gadgets with less harm to the planet.

We kicked off the project by inviting Kiwis to submit personal photos from the location that was most dear to them. Thousands of photos were submitted to a website where they were tinted with the specific colour swatch for that location and then displayed in our online gallery.

Yahoo! Bus Stop Derby - San Francisco Interactive Bus Stops,"Overview by Goodby Silverstein and Partners - San Francisco, CA  Campaign: ""Yahoo! asked us to help reclaim their role as the original social network.  They wanted to show how technology can bring people together offline in the same way that they bring communities together online.  We answered with the Yahoo! Bus Stop Derby. It transformed analog bus stops into social gaming hubs, where commuters played other bus stops in real time. San Francisco neighborhoods played against neighborhoods, battling it out to win a block party with music-video sensation OK Go in their neighborhood.""  A New Kind of Bus Stop: Out of Home, Meet Social Gaming: We partnered with Clear Channel Outdoor and SFMTA to pioneer twenty all-new bus stops with 72"" gaming screens, free wi-fi and social media built in. This let us transform bus stops into social gaming arcades that displayed real-time game results and a live Twitter feed of neighborhood smack-talk. The free wi-fi let people explore Yahoo's mobile apps and showed up in nearby cafes and parks, promoting the Derby beyond the physical stops.  The First Four Games for a Bus Stop: The four games were based on Yahoo!'s most popular mobile apps. Commuters could challenge other bus stops in sports trivia, instant messaging, a 3-D photo puzzle and speed-sorting emails. 77% of players said they felt Yahoo! was a ""more innovative company"" after they played.  Touch Technology: The Yahoo Bus Stop Derby is a technology story, too. The competition took place on 20, first-of-their-kind, interactive digital transit shelters. At 72"" they are the largest outdoor interactive touch screens in use today. We're not time-travelers but this feels like the future of the out of home medium to us.  The Bus Stop Derby Blog: We created a blog that kept players (and out-of-towners) up to speed. It featured a real-time Leaderboard, aggregated all Derby talk (and smack-talk) on Twitter, and pulled in commuters' Derby photos from Flickr.  North Beach Block Party: We're pretty sure we broke some interesting new ground in event-planning, too. The winners, a whole urban neighborhood, won a big block party with okgo playing a concert in their neighborhood. With a close race right up to the finish we had to be nimble enough to pull off an enormous party in any of the several potential frontrunner's neighborhoods with just seven days notice. A true exercise in logistics.",639,how do you take the most traditional of ad mediums and make it something people interact with cheer about check into and stand in line for you make it a game where commuters can play other bus stops live and head to head it's been called a lot of things but we call it the yahoo bus stop derby in 2010 the big story seemed to be that social media technology was ironically making people anti-social yahoo wanted to show how technology can bring people together in the real world just like they've always done online here's how the bus stop derby works players pick one of four games based on yahoo's most popular apps select a san francisco neighborhood to play for and challenge other bus stops in a real-time battle the points got tallied and after 10 weeks we had a neighborhood champion north beach and as a reward they got to host a block party for the entire city in their own neighborhood featuring online video sensation ok go right from the start the lines were drawn neighbors rallied neighbors and the game was on it got ugly it got loved but mostly it got talked about yahoo is making public transportation fun the largest outdoor touch screens in north america so what was the bus stop derby well it was a lot of things really all converging to help yahoo in its effort to reclaim its title as the most innovative place for bringing people together turns out this unprecedented mashup of out of home and social gaming struck a cord that resonated far beyond the bay area before the winning neighborhood had been decided yahoo had already received requests from people all over the world to bring the derby to their city sounds like a great idea to us

Komatsu Xtrem Precision Emailing, ,552,komatsu may be one of the world's biggest makers of industrial equipment but they have surprisingly few direct customers in fact here in Belgium there are only five companies big enough to be potential prospects that kind of got us thinking about a sort of mailing you can do to just five people and then we heard about the komatsu stunt team the camassia stunt team performs all around the world but for our five prospects they would do something they'd never tried before send them an email each of our targets received a message in their inbox with a web address that address took them to a film about who exactly is sent them the mail most people still don't believe it but no tricks or effects were used in its movie whatsoever and if you're still feeling a skeptical bear in mind that out of the five prospects are emailed all five became good times
BMW - The Fastest Christmas Song in the World,"Together with the agency Draftfcb (Lowe Zurich Switzerland) the social media team developed for BMW (Switzerland) the fastest Christmas song in the world.  BMW (Schweiz) AG has entrusted us with the challenge to create a social media campaign for digital christmas greetings.  So we came up with the idea of hiring the DTM racer Martin Tomczyk, provided him a BMW M135i and the ""Circuit de l'Anneau du Rhin"" and asked him to explore the limits of the car. To add a festive note, the ""Zurich Acapella Group"", a 4 person choir, has been invited to join the exhilarating ride, performing the world-famous Christmas song ""Jingle Bells"" whilst riding along.  The result of this unusual pairing was - along with a lot of joy - the ""Fastest Christmas Song In The World"".  For maximum viral spread of this kind of christmas greetings, the campaign has been placed on different channels. We've created the landing page (www.fastestchristmassong.ch), integrated a youtube video, added making of shots and provided the opportunity to send and share Christmas e-cards through Facebook-Connect. At the same time, the landing page became a Facebook App and was integrated into the fan page of BMW (Schweiz) AG, so we could solicit it vide Facebook.  Therefore we designed individual posts which have been spread over several fan pages with a significant number of fans. To reach an even bigger audience we used promoted posts and Facebook Ads.  Within 10 days after its launch the video came up with more than 1.1 Million views on YouTube and hundreds of thousands posts in social media platforms.  Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjncA7jau2g  https://www.facebook.com/SocialMediaTeam.de",546,the task bmw switzerland sends digital christmas cards to car enthusiasts around the world the solution the fastest christmas song in the world the starting point fastestchristmassong.ch a website designed to go viral the key elements were an embedded youtube video and all relevant social sharing functions one thing was missing a film with sweeping viral character the result the new version of jingle bells got over 1.1 million views on youtube visual and interactive optimizations for mobile devices led to a 20 increase of page visits resulting in over 250 000 external links to fastestchristmassong.ch thousands of comments on social networking sites over 120 million contacts due to enormous media coverage the result page views from 199 countries and we reached our goal in only 10 days the fastest christmas song went totally viral you

The Migros Beer,,536,in Switzerland we're slow to change our ways our mountains tend to always stay the same as does our habit of deciding everything by public vote and so does our largest retailer megro who has refused to sell any alcohol for a hundred years so in negro suddenly announced that they are now thinking of offering alcoholic beverages people got very angry at least by Swiss standards schnapps negro was criticized everywhere for even daring to think of this and they were now in a difficult position if they pushed forward they looked greedy if they backtracked indecisive and weak so what to do to start with it was decided to put the matter to a vote of course it was and then communication came into play but we knew that a simple ad campaign was not enough instead we turned the best method of conflict resolution and said let's have a drink shall we we invented the very first meatrow beer and we tied it to the outcome of the boat if the pro vote came through a wheat with alcohol would be released if the opposition won they could celebrate for the alcohol-free no this changed the perception completely instead of divisive politics a fun product took the stage the Swiss discussed amongst themselves and stopped slandering negro the additional attention the bear brought to the matter led to massive exposure on social media in newspapers and even with an hour-long dedicated program on National Television not surprisingly the votes resulted in a resounding not the beer hit the shelves shortly after and has to be restarted regularly and not only did we launch a successful new product but we substantially reinforced migro's status as a deeply Democratic and principled Institution so cheers to that foreign

'Google Deepmind AlphaGO' by Google Deepmind London for Google Deepmind,Innovation Grand Prix winner,488,one of the major challenges of artificial intelligence is creating programs that replicate the way people think and solve problems and one of the best ways to test an AI programs ability to do this is having it play games against human experts in chess they're about 20 possible moves from the average position on a board meaning an AI program like IBM's deep blue can calculate every possible option before deciding the right move however this brute force approach doesn't work for the ancient game of go it is considered to be the most complex game mankind has ever devised and the ultimate challenge for artificial intelligence why well can go there are about 200 possible moves in an average position making the number of possible board configurations more than the number of atoms in the entire universe meaning calculating every possible option would take millions of years also chess is a game of logic whereas go is primarily based on feel and intuition things people are good at but AI has so far not been able to replicate until this year when researchers from google deepmind created an AI program called alpha go which be two of the best professional go players in the world for the first time ever how by an innovative use of two deep neural networks a policy network and a value Network the policy Network narrows down the choices allowing alpha go to concentrate on a couple of promising moves instead of considering every possible option on the board the value network allows alpha go to estimate which side is winning the game from a particular position without having to consider every option right down to the end of the game this way of problem-solving is something google deepmind scientists describe as something more akin to intuition today AI programs are winning complex board games but tomorrow the techniques behind alpha go might help us as a society to solve some of the world's biggest challenges you

(PSA) Candy Store - Partnership for a Drug-Free America,"Thank you for watching, liking, subscribing, and/or sharing the video. Currently, this channel is in a transitional phase. Please be patient as bugs and errors will be corrected by the first week of January, 2020. Thank you for watching, liking, subscribing, and/or sharing the video.  Currently, not allowed to have descriptions or comments until further notice. (Thank you to the rude viewers who left me death threats and other bad insults.)  Hopefully, everything will return to normal soon.  We want to thank YouTube and their parent companies for all the help and cooperation. And we thank you, for your continued support. The following are the things you should focus on when it comes to video optimization.  i. Video Title. As we discussed in the previous point, the title is the most important aspect of your video page. It will help you rank on search engines and at the same time, you can create your title so that when someone looks at it, they will want to click on it even out of curiosity. Remember, it’s not only about where you rank, it’s also about how many of those that will see your listing will click on it.  ii. Video Description. The second most important element on your video page! This is where you will write what your visitor will learn after viewing this video and also include links to your business blog and/or where this video is posted on your blog. You want to add links there because if you don’t you won’t be able to tell your viewers what you want them to do next. You should also include your main keyword in your description as it will help a lot with your ranking efforts.  iii. Video Tags. You should use tags, it’s one of the best ways to categorize your video and one of the few ways for YouTube to understand what your video is about. Tags play a very important role when it comes to related videos (videos that are suggested from YouTube on the right side of the page or after a video ends) so use them but don’t abuse them.  You should add all the relevant keywords that your video is about and if you are out of ideas, do see what others with almost the same title and content have used.  The more impressions you get, the more YouTube will suggest relevant keywords for you to use on each one of your videos.  That takes us to the next point that could easily be included here but it’s so important that should be a whole category by it self.  iv. Video filename. I haven’t split-tested this personally but there are so many people stating that your video filename should be optimized that I have to include it here also. What they mean by that is that when you upload a video to YouTube, you should rename it before in order to use your main keywords. For example you shouldn’t upload a video named sally004.mp4 but rename it into something like sally-cooks-ravioli.mp4 so that even from the filename, YouTube understands what it’s about.  I would perform a split test to see if that theory actually works, but to tell you the truth, it’s an action step that requires so little time that I always do it no matter what.",479,this place is a dump man you ain't gonna make no money in here you don't know nothing I don't know nothing I know that this is rotten I know they don't see no people in here so where's your gold mine it's down the street right the school the school oh I see you're gonna get rich on selling gone to school kids not gummy this for ten dollars to little snot-nosed as complete as are the little brats are dying to fry their brains and not only do happy to help it so where do they get the money cares where they gave as long as they can [Music]

Golf Punk HypnoMarketing - Case study,"We used the misconception that advertising brainwashes consumers. We manipulated this insight and created Hypnomarketing, a fake firm (with a GM and office) that turns young people into lifelong brand advocates through the power of hypnosis.     We used product to incentise people to attend HypnoMarketing sessions. Golf Punk was integrated into each session and product sold at the end. Footage from the sessions was published on P2P websites. The media was outraged, HypnoMarketing's GM was inundated with interview requests. Resulting media coverage propelled Golf Punk ""front of mind"" with both customers and retailers.",351,every trick including hypnosis to get you to buy is it real how they make you spend without you knowing they are the newest forms of advertising but how ethical are they the concern is that people might be having this done to them without their knowledge not all marketing is as obvious or gives consumers a choice the approach so subtle and Silent you may not even recognize that someone is selling you something he's planting suggestions into impressionable young minds it almost sounds like they're trying to turn customers and robots who are going to go out there and buy anything that they're told to edgy streetwear brand golf Punk is deliberately antagonistic they're anti-everything attitude appeals to juvenile delinquents and Adrenaline Junkies their Communications needed to reflect this controversial you don't get it and we don't care positioning however over recent years golf Punk had begun to lose its Edge we've identified a controversial topic that we knew would resonate with our audience then we manipulated it to maximize controversy we found ways to speed up the brainwashing process based on this Insight we created Hypno marketing a new marketing technique from the US which hypnotizes consumers to become brand advocates for life we created a deliberately low-fight website at www.hypnomarketing.biz where we explain the concept and invited people to participate in a Hypno marketing session we positioned golf punk as Hypno marketing's Foundation clients in Australia and promised food drink and clothing in exchange for programming people to be golf Punk's brand advocates for life we also used Street Media to invite people to the event and to create Buzz it's fronted by an unknown actor we gave him an American accent to increase his credibility in the Australian Market see here is the is the normal people and love it forever I'm very excited to see that we have a golf Punk of the first brand in Australia to uh to have harness the powers of different markets for life not only that you may feel them to help Gavin Hawk introduced our hypnotist who invited people on stage to become golf Punk brand advocates foreign ups for the second event came in thick and fast at the end all participants were brought out of the trance and would remember nothing of the experience however we left the audience believing they were still programmed to be golf Punk Advocates I had no control over what I was doing but um I knew exactly what I was doing in my mind kind of like I had to do what he said like mesmerized I don't know it was weird we published footage from the Melbourne event on peer-to-peer websites and the media took the bait stories began to appear everywhere I called out marketing Guru Harry and I discovered this is for Real very good afternoon can you just confirmed that this is not a prank I hope no marketing is in fact real it is real it's been launched by Americans in Australia the reaction was massive web chatter went into overdrive reaching people across Australia and around the world Prime Time TV show today tonight featured a lengthy segment on Hypno marketing hypnosis is the power of suggestion it's concentrated attention and the power of suggestion so advertisers are using it all the time Hypno marketing lures young people along to their shows on behalf of a client with the promise of free food clothing and you get you have food and booze so in they come willing guinea pigs at this mesmerizing meat the subjects if you like come in get hypnotized leave and then they're I guess they're sort of like a Trojan for the rest of their lives we hope uh selling whatever product one two three eyes open get changed the campaign gave a massive boost to golf Punk's profile and achieved our aim of positioning them in a highly controversial space foreign
"R/GA Ad Council ""Thats Not Cool""",This video is part of case study that you can find on http://ipgives.interpublic.com/,350,we're back now and we're talking about cyber abuse at the hands of other teens through social networking sites text messages and emails three teenage girls were charged with disseminating child pornography for texting nude photos of themselves to their boyfriends everyone has these photos of her somebody hacked into her profile on facebook some of these teams may not realize they're really being stalked by their boyfriends texting facebook she's always i am it's really hard to deal with the ad council asked us to help curb teen dating violence but when we started talking to kids we found that teen dating has gone digital and abuse has followed we had stumbled on a huge problem that had no laws and no defined boundaries a problem no one was addressing the more we talked to teens the more we realized they wouldn't listen to adults preaching at them about such a personal subject so our strategy was to develop a campaign that empowered teens themselves to decide what is right and wrong the result was that's not cool.com because we wanted to reach teams where the abuse is happening our campaign is centered in the digital space the website acted as a hub for conversation and was supported with an integrated 360 campaign the site experience that's not cool.com begins with interactive videos that educate teens about common problems from both a boy and girl's point of view i can't be away from my girlfriend for 10 minutes without her texting me i'd never had a real boyfriend before you think you could get her to send some nude pics is she messaging him i feel pressured what's he thinking what am i supposed to do click a b or c and they can choose for themselves how to handle problems see send her pics of my junk yeah that's it take it off get nasty you nasty apple i think when you talk about things that are bothering you it makes it a lot easier to avoid problems like this popular youtube celebs created their own videos to show kids they're not alone i think we should break up forms helped kids talk give advice and share their stories and we gave teens tools to do something about the problem call of cards could be sent to a partner's phone email or social network to gently say you've crossed the line in outdoor and print teens could snap a photo with their phone and send it to someone who is pressuring them or making them feel uncomfortable and for anyone who needs serious help there's a place to find answers and chat live with a professional with a digital platform in place we invited teams to join the conversation with advertising like web banners social networks and youtube tv wakey wakey luv love you hollaback hollaback nude pics send me some radio i'd rather not send you nude pictures my webcam is broken nudity makes me vomit outdoor and print and a mobile site the campaign helped start a conversation in the media about the problem with feature stories in the new york times and on the today show the ad council hopes its website that's not cool will get teens to realize what is inappropriate behavior since it's launched the site has had seven hundred thousand unique visitors over twenty eight thousand call of cards sent and almost two hundred thousand video views more and more teams are joining the discussion deciding what's right and wrong and creating a new set of rules in their own terms with a little help they're dealing with one of the most daunting problems facing them as they grow up in the digital age turns out if you give teams the tools it takes to start a discussion treat them with respect and get out of the way they'll take it from there that's not cool.com

Nickelodeon and Lego Turn TV Station Off, ,337,children watch too much tv they should be spending more time playing therefore our client legal planned the more play less tv campaign for its latest line of board games but children's tv is the number one medium for toy manufacturers so how can an advertiser use tv while at the same time encourage viewers to watch less tv the answer was very simple we turn off a children's channel so that the kids have more time to play less staring at the screen more playing lego thought it was a brilliant idea and was totally thrilled but where could we find a children's channel that would go along with this since it would mean losing viewer ratings and advertising revenue wow the children's channel nickelodeon said yes and on may 28 2010 the channel was switched off for six hours well not quite there was a message on the black screen today we're playing and not watching tv at first children were not so happy about this but their mothers were thrilled they loved this joint venture by lego and nickelodeon and that made lego happy in the run-up to the special advertising campaign announcements had been made via lego tv commercials nickelodeon trailers and online advertising on nickelodeon.de this way kids and parents had enough time to stock up on lego so they could have a great time playing together the success of the campaign exceeded everyone's expectations on internet forums parent sites facebook the campaign created a buzz all over the internet nickelodeon's acceptance with parents increased retailers were thrilled and lego itself was quite amazed because during the campaign period awareness of lego board games increased by 28 the desire to buy them increased by 71 ownership increased by 67 we think this idea is fantastic it should be done more often who knows of further channels that would like to be turned off

Flock Associates - Chevrolet: Chevy Game Time Integrated Campaign by Goodby Silverstein & Partners,"http://www.flock-associates.com  In an effort to stand out from competitors' advertising during the Super Bowl, Chevy created the interactive campaign 'Chevy Game Time'. The campaign was created by the combined efforts of Goodby Silverstein & Partners, Detroit Labs, ePrize, and Gentleman Scholar. The campaign mainly consisted of an app that got users involved in a trivia game with questions regarding the Chevy ads that played during the Super Bowl allowing participants to interact with the live broadcast and commercials. The strategy being that people would have to pay extra attention to the Chevy commercials while also ignoring the rest of the ads that run during the commercial break in order to complete the trivia game. The incentive that effectively caught the public's attention and ensured the success of the campaign was the possibility to win a brand new Chevy if the game was completed successfully.  This live second screen experience was able to get 21 million questions answered by the end of the game while the app had over 700,000 users and was a featured app in both iTunes and Android stores.  http://www.flock-associates.com",275,super bowl is the most watched american television broadcast of the year drawing over 100 million viewers with almost 50 advertisers competing for viewers attention how do you stand out we decided to game the system and add another screen over 50 percent of people go to a super bowl party for something other than watching the game the chevy game time app a live second screen experience gave them a legit reason to play with their phones for hours the game time app was designed to hijack viewers attention for the entire game it gave people a reason to focus on our ads very closely and distracted them from watching our competitors ads we started by previewing our super bowl spots on the app letting people know they could win cars from our commercials on game day we got people to answer trivia questions about our ads during commercial breaks since this could win you a chevy entire super bowl parties watched our ads very closely first on tv then again on the app to make double sure people would be focused on our ads we gave each app user a license plate and if you spotted your plate in our commercials you won the car which of course got app users to watch our ads again and again all the while racking up our youtube views the app extended the game beyond tv by letting people interact with the broadcast in a totally new way a team of 20 writers and technicians pushed real-time questions and polls to the app letting players react to what they just saw on tv and when we asked people to do something they did at times drawing 130 000 players to answer a question at the same time more than double the attendance at the super bowl stadium by the end of the game we had over 21 million questions answered the app had over 700 000 users was the featured app in both itunes and android stores and made it to the top 10 in the itunes app store past angry birds and facebook owning the super bowl now there's an app for that

Visitors were then given a jazz playlist that corresponded to the trip, taking as long as it would take to emit the same carbon dioxide.

EXCITING OFFERS NEED EXCITING ADS Virgin Mobile,"CAMPAIGN DESCRIPTION  Virgin Mobile’s customer-focused philosophy spawned a “reality-advertising” campaign that put the public in control. The campaign launched the new 10c per minute calls to anyone, anytime rate (also known as the MotorMouth Recharge Voucher) and a high-end Motorola V3 handset. From a business point of view we needed to approach the campaign in a more aggressive, acquisitional way that didn’t sacrifice the core Virgin customer-centric philosophy. “Exciting Offers Need Exciting Ads” truly demonstrated that Virgin Mobile doesn’t just say the customer is in control, it delivers.  IMPLEMENTATION  Russell, the unremarkable campaign hero, miserably advertised VMA’s new offers. A TVC invited viewers to give VMA’s ad a makeover, directing online to vote on which genre, music, costume and co-star they wanted to see in the new ad. Boring online advertising and in-store posters demanded the public’s help to improve the advertising. Favorites were used to create the TVC and subsequent advertising was refreshed with winning creative. Premiere was promoted using “top n tail” TV spots, online advertising and in Virgin Mobile stores and retail partners. The 60” TV epic premiered at a peak time and contained amongst other things a naked Russell and a haunted house.  RELEVANCY  During the initial day or “voting stage” of the campaign, almost 10,000 votes were submitted via online and IVR. Over 10 days there were 10,000 clicks on the online banner executions and there were 21,000 page views on the campaign website. All of this was achieved with a very light media commitment. In ROI terms there was an average of 20,497 new pre-paid customers per month over the campaign which was a 12.5 percent increase on the pre-campaign period.

VW_Safe Happens Integrated,,51,by 2006 there was plenty of bad news at volkswagen a once beloved brand had lost its relevance and suffered five consecutive years of sales declines but there was a bright spot within it all both jetta and passat happened to include a rather impressive laundry list of german engineered safety features an intelligent crash response system six standard airbags anti-lock braking system electronic brake pressurized distribution a lower anchor and tether system electronic stabilization program active seat restraints crash optimized front end anti-intrusion side door beams and a five-star front side impact rating unfortunately when you put it that way it's a big snore most automobile safety ads relied on the same old formula controlled collisions in controlled environments with simulated human beings and always talked about avoiding the accident this was the inspiration for safe happens it just gives me the feeling like she's not like listening to me have you tried not saying like every other word what remember your ski trip story yeah i was like going down the hill and like this guy like cut me off and like there was a crowd and like and i was like look stuff either happens or it doesn't happen stuff doesn't sort of like happen holy on the web safe took a more lighthearted turn as surfers managed to survive internet dings in the same way that drivers encounter surprises along the road oink [Music] on banners that clicked right through to vwfeatures.com at vwfeatures.com shoppers lovingly customize their very own jettas before using a menu to lovingly pulverize it in equally customizable short films [Music] [Music] letting safe happen just the way it should in the most unexpected circumstances suddenly a taboo of car advertising showing your own car in less than pristine condition was tossed onto the shoulder like an old shoe the sight of a crunched jetta even became somewhat iconic in brochures ads for auto shows and even in and around vw dealerships who cried i did i mean it was a sad ending and everything i just i saw you with your hand in your chin that's called concentrating on the moment it's more like holding your quivering upper leg exactly i wasn't crying okay i mean seriously i don't know why safe happens ignited one of the most robust conversations of the year and like any good conversation it started with questions but how many stars for the ad does it go to form what in the world is vw trying to accomplish here does this make you want to buy that exactly or not many are calling the company demanding to know if the actors sustained serious injuries while talking heads talked bloggers blocked and critics critiqued consumers well consumed but the brand was listening and saw fit to respond with the 2006 passat so they're just driving along talking about whatever and suddenly wham i know i saw it i just think maybe they went too far i think where they went was real but is it just shocking for the sake of shocking look i think being in an accident isn't a shock that's what they call it an accident yeah but you're watching tv commercial comes out from times square this is good morning america while some might question the tactics behind the new volkswagen ads there's no doubt they're working after a disastrous 2005 sales are up this year by 20 this is exactly the way accidents happen it's perfectly captured it breaks all the rules of advertising everybody's talking about it in the blogosphere and everywhere else and sales were up dealers relayed anecdotes about customers entering dealerships describing quote those freaky jetta commercials on showroom floors across the country the conversation had turned to safe safe happens proof that when safe becomes just as startling as danger it magically becomes relevant thanks for watching
